      This course is woke af. It makes sense that in some criminology degrees this is a core course because there is a lot of 'theoretical' content from reading frequent criminology extracts from
      articles and books regarding things like the standard of innocence, the nature of what crime or 'truth' even is, the key common law assumptions behind how offences are designed by Parliament, how police
      constantly fuck up and abuse their powers time and time and time again that it is borderline ironic and a scourge on any sense of legality in modern society, and
      how some parts of law and criminalisation can be seen as the government trying to enforce social control and a farcical sense of order moreso than any relationship with
      justice. The course then concludes on some oft-overlooked areas of criminal offences in law study - namely offensive language/conduct and drugs. While this course really opens your eyes, if not
      ethically or morally, at least intellectually into how law can't be seen in isolation as a pure compact of syllogism and neat facts, my only criticms is that sometimes it veers a little too theoretical
      at the expense of actually learning how to adequately apply some of the stricter rules.

      This course is mainly theoretical - you learn about how crime is defined and the aims of the criminal law in the first place, as well as criticisms of all those perspectives. There is a brief segue into
      how police powers are administered under LEPRA, as well as some statutory interpretation points regarding how to convert the language of a statute into actual components - conduct, circumstances, and consequences -
      as well as discerning mens rea elements for each. Then you examine how the criminal justice system is structured via analysing different parts of the criminal process, such as the ideological or at least procedural divison between the
      higher courts - District and above - versus the lower courts - primarily the Local court, as well as issues regarding bail and deaths in custody while on remand or being processed into a jail, certain drives for efficiency (regulatory fines,
      expanding summary justice and reducing the threshhold for jury verdicts), and the importance of pre-trial decision making by prosecutors and police in the final outcome for an accused person through negotiating pleas or interrogations. These
      theoretical aspects mainly rely on some very revealing case studies, some funny (eg Osama Bin Laden at APEC, or the goverment withdrawing COVID fines because they didn't comply with thier own legislation) and some incredibly tragic and heartbreaking
      (such as the excessive use of force by police, assuming people are faking being sick before they die in custody, and police generally being dickheads to most people, especially Aboriginal people). Sometimes shit got quite heavy and disturbing,
      and hearing about the conditions some people were in borderline was like torture (eg dying because you were transported in a glorified microwave in a police truck). You could be the most cold-hearted person in the world and the shit you see will move you
      into realising that one of the best proofs we have that we are living in a matrix is that the police haven't been torn down as an establishment, even in spite of all their self-claimed safeguards and broader role in fairly 'protecting society', whatever that means.
      Probably the most interesting thing is realising how politics ties into everything eg politicans claiming they're tough on crime and fanning the flames of some hidden rapture that never actually happens if you look outside the mainstream media.

      During this mostly theoretical component (which encompasses around 5-6 weeks) there are only some brief opportunities to do problem question type writing practice - these topics are doli incapax, police powers to stop and search, and arrest, and bail. However,
      you get enough practice with these (eg one lesson is devoted entirely to roleplaying as a magistrate, defendant, and prosecutor reenacting a bail hearing). Police powers are probably the most important and were always in the final exam, although doli incapax and bail
      have also showed up less commonly (only once each). In the last two lessons, you do public order offences (offensive language and conduct) and drug offences (the classic ones like possesion, supply, manufacture, prohibited plants, etc). These topics by far make up for the relative
      lack of problem solving, because there is so much nuance and a lot of rules you may need to understand. This part of the course, however, was by far the most interesting, especially after already knowing about using statutory interpretation to decide on
      their components (actus reus, mens rea). The statute also does some pretty quirky things which are quite interesting if not unjust (for example, deemed supply provisions in the DMTA).

      Class participation is worth 10%, so there was a lot less stress to talk, although this was actually one of those subjects (similar to high school Legal Studies) where people wanted to talk anyway because you didn't need much reading to offer a somewhat intelligent and nuanced
      perspective (it was very political). The midterm requires you to do statutory interpretation for a particular offence to analyse its actus reus and mens rea components (with a focus on HKT, ie Hawk Tuah, ie He Kaw Teh), as well as a somewhat mini essay (around 750 words) regarding whether
      the proposed offence would be a good addition to criminal law (after thinking about how criminalisation is often the wrong remedy to a social problem, and the potential abuses of it all, etc). I absolutely bombed the shit out of the statutory interpretation part of the midterm which was quite a
      shame because I made some insane blunders in terms of presentation and overuserd the shit out of headings. My advice is to just introduce by saying what He Kaw Teh is even about, and then talk about each limb of the offence more broadly instead of scruitinising each particular phrase alone. Looking at how
      the textbook analyses public order and drug offences later in the course will help you a lot (and I'm surprised they weren't done earlier to help us, although maybe this was deliberate). Getting shit on that midterm part although I did fine in the essay is lowkey the biggest blunder of my
      law study so far, especially since I thought I was cooking when I was writing it and spent a lot of effort on it. I encourage people not to make the same mistake I did D:

      The final exam was not too bad, being split into a problem question and an essay, although there was some problems with convening it such that everyone was allowed to resit the exam if they wanted (although I declined because I felt I did alright and was otherwise too lazy). Unlike previous terms, here
      the problem question involved police powers (search and arrest), offensive language offences, and drug offences. Pretty clear and easy to get through, although having to keeping track of the word count (yes, strangely there was a fucking word count) was a questionable choice. Throughout the term, you were supposed to
      observe 5 hours of higher courts and 10 hours of lower courts, put your observations into a log, submit it just before the final exam, and then use your observations to respond to a criminal process question. I initially hated this decision to make us observe criminal procedure, but going to court is actually a
      whole new experience in itself that would also take up as long as this review to write about. If the log was satisfactory (think competency gradings), you would instantly get 25% of the marks for the essay compoent Writing the essay with those observations was also pretty chill.

      Overall, this course was pretty great and I ended up really liking both the theory and the actual problem question parts, although there was a bit too much theory for my liking. In rating the course I have also tried not to be biased because of my catasrophic failure in the midterm. Since the readings are relatively light,
      and it overall doesn't really take much effort beyond the court observation log, I recommend taking it with more interesting or substantial courses while you have the opportunity.

      This course is really not that difficult and one of the easiest law courses you can probably do. It is around the same difficult as Year 11-12 Legal Studies, but it definitely spikes up when you
      start doing some of the more legal parts of the course (police powers, public order, drugs). Once again, do your readings because there's really not that much. Perhaps physically the hardest thing to do is attend court and
      put your thoughts down into something that reflects a nuanced take on criminal process.

  <ReviewSection title="Enjoyment">
    <p>
      This course didn't really start as the most enjoyable thing in the world (a criminology perspective on the meaning and nature of 'crime') but I recognised its importance. This reaction I had also was quite consistent throughout the rest of the course. Sometimes the readings were just super dry that I lowkey just skipped them for the first time
      (eg STMPs, which strangely ended up in the final exam's problem question and which I only vaguely remembered and used to show how police targeted people without reasonable grounds...). However, it was still quite interesting, especially when you got to some of the more tragic or interesting case studies. By far the most interesting things were
      learning about how criminal offences are interpreted in statute (I did not do it justice in my midterm....), police powers, drugs, and public order offences (I thought having sex in public while your window was open and having an officer peer through the curtains was fucking insane). I probably laughed more than average in this course, but also
      had genuine reflections on the fairness of the world, and also was bored out of my mind in equal measure. At least this course is dynamic like that instead of being 100% boring, though, I'll be honest.

  <ReviewSection title="Effort">
    <p>
      Do your readings you fucking bum. Apart from the court observation log, there's not really anything that strenuous about this course. I never felt pressured or stressed about an assignment being due. I'd say around 3-4 hours per week of readings, combined
      of course with having to attend your classes/seminars in person. There are also no online modules here. For what this course lacks in terms of effort it more than makes up for emotionally - some things here are quite distressing and heartbreaking.

    <p>
      When I did this course, the new edition of the textbook was just released. However, because of delays in publishing, they gave us everything we needed as extracts - this was so fucking nice! Note however that we would also need the textbook later since it was the same one for LAWS1022. The textbook was pretty clean
      and everything was pretty easy to understand (I am including the textbook because it was written by the UNSW crime faculty or people adjacent). Also, my lecturer was relatively chill (although it felt a bit bad when people would talk over them). No real qualms, apart from a relative lack to talk about problem question stuff, but otherwise
      everything was delivered pretty cleanly and efficiently.

  <ReviewSection title="Utility">
    <p>
      This subject is very useful, not only because of the court observation log (which by itself gets you more experience pre-job than anything else at university) but because it sets you up for statutory interpretation and the second subject on crime, as well as a small introduction to the
      Evidence Act (which I hear is scary, but haven't done yet). Moving aside from the fact that law courses are expensive as fuck, at a cost of $2 124 or around $240 a week, its lowkey very worth it.
