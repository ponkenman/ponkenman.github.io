    <p>Prerequisites: COMP1511</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      A very interesting course that shifts between the most boring thing in the world to the most fun and intellectually stimulating
      content in the world. When we first did sorting algorithms I genuinely felt like I was about to go into a coma from how drowsy
      I was getting. However, binary search trees and graphs are much more fun, especially when you get to play around with stacks and
      queues. Hash tables, priority queues, and tries were also very fun, but a bit neglected. Recursion was trippy at first but also
      very fun to play around and experiment with. The lecturer was a bit dry (in fact, incredibly dry and unmotivating) and I can blame this course
      for being the reason I began skipping COMP lectures.

      However the labs are very fun. I found it quite annoying that you had to get handmarked, but there is some controversy surrounding
      people cheating and getting away with it, so I kind of get it. The best part of the course is optimising your algorithms and making
      them as fast as possible. I am still sad about only doing an O(V^2) solution that received partial marks instead of an O(V) solution
      in the final exam. However, this course really challenges your abstract thinking and it is very satisfying to finally have something
      work. The only real issue I had with this course were those weekly quizzes, which really stressed me out from not being able to get
      instant feedback like in MATH course quizzes. I want my full marks! Overall, however, the good outweighed the bad!

      I wrote the part of the review above back when I actually took the course and am now extending it to fit the other reviews. I'm leaving
      the above mostly the same but also note that there are two assignments which aren't too bad and are pretty chill.

      There are a lot of new data structures that were a bit hard to learn at first, but eventually through regular practice you get familiar with them
      (eg binary search trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables). The most difficult thing is potentially knowing how to accurately define the big-O notation
      of some more complicated algorithms that you create yourself. However, everything is doable with enough effort and as long as you put in the practice
      it isn't difficult to the point of debillitation! This course was also a lot like MATH1081 in terms of subject matter (graphs and creative thinking) so
      take them together like I did for an easier time!

      Some of this shit is boring as fuck its unreal (eg sorts). However some of this is also super interesting (eg using trees and graphs to model, playing around
      with stacks and queues). This is like extending the good parts of COMP1511 (ie solving fun problems in creative and interesting ways) with some more complicated but
      ultimately understandable data structures.

      Labs and quizzes take like 3-4 hours a week maximum. Assignments are chill and maybe take 15 hours total for each. Final exam was also
      quite doable. This is another chill course and you don't have to put in THAT much effort (unless there are some parts you struggle on).

      It gets a bit tight near the end of the term where you learn about hash tables and tries but don't really have that much time to play around with them. However, the
      labs are a good place to get practice. Honestly the lectures are abysmal and this is the first course I lowkey just stopped bothering with COMP lectures. It's a lowkey shame
      because this course would otherwise be spectacular (or maybe it's just a sign of my "learning" growing beyond lectures or whatever).

      The labs and assignments actually help you quite a bit in learning the content which is nice. I was a bit annoyed with the labs requiring you to get your solution marked off by a tutor,
      but my tutor was lowkey chill af and nice even if they weren't the most engaging. I've heard that there was a lot of pressure to get your shit marked off in in person labs but
      I'm a lazy af online camper and I could always get shit marked off on time. The only real gripe I have is that the weekly quizzes were kind of stessful in not giving
      you quick feedback or letting you change your answers but its whatever and they're only 10%.

      Very useful course (particularly if you want to get a job somewhere which uses these kind of data structure questions as interview topics), but also in giving you more confidence in knowing
      how to design and understand different algorithms and data structures. This is probably the most interesting area of computer science (especially modelling real life situations to use particular
      data structures and knowing the pros and cons of each eg time memory tradeoffs). The $1 118 ie $124 dollars a week ish was a fair price.
