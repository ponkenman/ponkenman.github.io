      This is the greatest COMP course I have ever taken so far. Front end development is not only interesting as fuck but it
      gives you the tools to do literally anything. I was inspired as fuck after taking this course so I decided to make this
      website. I know this course is self learnable or whatever but I don't give a fuck. The content is taught so well and I embrace
      the philosophy behind the course (as attempting to give students the fundamental skills and design patterns to be clean programmers)
      as 100% accurate to how this course is taught. Another benefit of the skills taught here is that design in itself is ultimately an
      expression of your individuality, from the colours you choose to the amount of empty space you decide to put to designing button interactivity.
      This entire course was so fun and it felt like I was drawing cute little pictures. If you're interested in literally creating anything by yourself
      you should take this course. There's also the fact that most jobs require front end but I don't give a shit about that. Just being able
      to create things people (potentially) can use while maintaining the fucking philosophy is just fucking beautiful.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This course begins with the ultimate basics - learning HTML and CSS - for the first few weeks, before gradually dipping its toes (ayo) into
      vanilla Javascript (to add dynamic elements or interactivity eg filling in forms) and then transitioning into using pure React. The course
      progression felt incredibly fluid and coherent and very easy to get into and it really teaches you the role of each of these languages.
      HTML and CSS might feel a bit scary at first because of the amount of choices you can make in design but I feel this course adequately teaches
      you appropriate design patterns (eg dont use too many colours and don't make it look bad nerdge). The pacing of this course is also perfect in
      my opinion - nearly the last 3-4 weeks are exclusively devoted to React (which mirrored the time needed to get a little familiar with it) and
      yet so much was taught. One unique thing is that this course doesn't really rely on live lectures, but rather pre-recorded ones (frequently from)
      guest lecturers from Canva and etc, which I actually quite liked. Watching bite-sized videos exclusively devoted to a particular topic is something
      other courses should do just in terms of sheer productivity and efficiency and ensuring a high standard of teaching and consistency and shit. There
      are also live lectures you can attend (although I didn't really watch them :P) but they were more peripheral eg easing people in on how to do certain
      things related to assignments (but assuming they watched all the recorded lectures).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      There are no labs or tests in this course which I really like and think it suits front end particularly well. Front end is the kind of thing where
      you put so much effort into something that it isn't something you can really test in a short or fast paced amount of time compared to say 'simple'
      programming. There are only three (well four) assignments, making 80% total, and a final exam, worth 20%. The first assignment got you to mimic screenshots
      as websites using only HTML and CSS, which I really liked and found quite fun and interesting and unique in a COMP course. The second assignment, which
      was really the course's single lab in disguise and stealing 5% from the first assignment, got you to add some simple interactivity using Javascript
      to a form (ie changing a message based on how inputs and checkboxes were filled in). I think Javascript and ultimately Typescript is, for now, my favourite
      language to code in (you can check out <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp1531" color="text-[#6029d6]">my COMP1531 review</InTextLink> for more). The second assignment definitely stepped up in difficulty but wasn't too bad - basically
      got you to manipulate the DOM dynamically with Javascript and create a shitty prototype version of Linkedin (called LurkForWork, honestly a nice name).
    </p>

      Assignment 4 is basically assignment 3 but harder and with React. Its not really that difficult but the sheer amount of features you need to add - you really are creating an entire
      functional website - makes it quite long to work on. It used pretty much the exact same project idea as <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp1531" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP1531</InTextLink> - creating a Kahoot ripoff - which I thought was a nice
      callback to <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp1531" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP1531</InTextLink>. Its recommended you do assignment 4 with a partner, and my partner was a little shoddy and sometimes made me want to bash my head against a wall
      over and over again from their lowkey sheer incompetence and frustrating questions they'd ask me when if only they'd actually read the spec in their own time it would be answered
      for them, and this was also the only assignment I kind of had to rush the deadline for and thus got fucked over in because of it but whatever, and you can also do it by yourself
      with more lenience in the marking. Honestly maybe I really am just built different or whatever where I should have been more patient and less frustrated with my partner, but even in
      spite of the workload I probably would have done assignment 4 by myself even if I had the chance. I've heard people compare assignment 4's workload to completing the entirety
      of the <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp1531" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP1531</InTextLink> group project by yourself and I think I agree with that.

    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The final exam is online (I really liked that although apparently they might change it in the future D:) and you had three hours to code some simple
      games in React. Honestly I found the workload quite high for 3 hours but I wasn't really stressing out. I could do the general website structure (dashboard etc) +
      the first two games (a number memory game and a scuffed point and click treasure hunt) and had like 5 minutes of work on a Flappy Bird ripoff. There was also a section about
      recording points in a scoreboard modal popup that I didn't do, but I don't give a shit and found the exam quite fun and chill and low stress. It was much less difficult
      and I'd actually compare the difficulty to a lab. The exam is delivered by giving access to a personal Gitlab repo that you can setup with your own tools a dayish
      before the actual exam (I personally just pushed my solution to a practice or sample exam that had everything like a basic dashboard setup, router to the three different
      pages, etc) and then emailing the exam spec out when the exam started. I overall found it to be quite chill and enjoyable.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it isn't clear from me glazing this course over and over, this is phenomenal and a high as fuck recommendation to anyone with a soul that likes seeing their hard work turn into things
      people actually use a lot quicker (not to shit on other things but the return on investment in front end is so quick its fucking crazy). I would also recommend doing this as early as possible
      (such as me doing it in the first term of my second year) because it really helps you actually program for fun (like this little website AYAYA)!

  <ReviewSection title="Difficulty">
    <p>
      In one of the first lectures (or maybe one from a previous course because before I took this I watched some public lectures to figure out whether it was worth it) this course was described as
      being a different kind of difficult, as it focused more on depth rather than breadth. As an example, this course was juxtaposed with <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp2521" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP2521</InTextLink> - where you learn very specific particular things
      like binary search trees, graphs, etc and are tested on the depth of your understanding on those things only - as in COMP6080 you're tested on literally everything to do with web development
      and (because you can compare things visually) know exactly when your program is wrong. There's also a lot of different things in web development eg if you want to use a framework, or all the different built in browser APIs,
      or how to deploy a website, and so many approaches for a particular solution. If you're a perfectionist you might struggle with knowing that your work isn't finished and get stressed.
      compared with, for example, a Maths subject where you think everything is correct but it isn't. I think thats fair but on the other hand this course is so interesting that the difficulty pretty much
      goes away. HTML and CSS are pretty chill to understand once you have the basics of semantic HTML (eg buttons vs anchors) and some essential CSS things (eg flexbox and grids, or using a
      framework like TailwindCSS which I particularly like). Vanilla Javascript is assumed from <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp1531" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP1531</InTextLink> and the only 'new' things you are taught are asynchronous programming (restricted to using .then in
      assignment 3 and then being allowed to use async/await in assignment 4), as well as differences between Javascript rendered on a browser compared with in a terminal and having access to a command line interface.
      Some key differences include learning about the existence of localStorage and window properties (eg innerHeight, hash locations). Overall, however, what you learn isn't insanely difficult, and in fact
      I would consider this course as intellectually easier than something like <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp2521" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP2521</InTextLink> - in fact, it might be similar to something like <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp1521" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP1521</InTextLink> or <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp1531" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP1531</InTextLink>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      You would think that the course would get more difficult with React but in my opinion it made it much easier just for being able to manipulte the DOM with JSX and TSX. I fucking hated having to physically writee
      createElement for everything in assignment 3 but was able to get through it simply because I was ignorant. React was fucking beautiful and clean in comparison, although understanding the point of useState and good
      design patterns from useEffect took a little bit of extra research. What I like about this course, however, is that if you do need further guidance it gives you enough knowledge about the current industry and the way
      modern web development works so that you're pretty much super confident with learning other tools (for example, to make this website which is pretty much static and has no need for React except for some parts, I learnt Astro js,
      and for some other potentially given up on but potentially still possible side projects I'm working on as of writing I learnt a bit of next js). Near the end of assignment 4 - when you start looking into deployment (we used vercel)
      or doing E2E and component testing, it gets a little hard as you really have to do your own research, but its ultimately a small part of the entire course.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>As a point of reference, these assignments are very easy to get 95-100% in whether through bonus marks or otherwise (except for maybe the fucked assignment 4 workload if you were unorganised like me and my partner were).</p>

  <ReviewSection title="Enjoyment">
    <p>
      I enjoyed this course 100% of the time. This course was like learning something I actually wanted to learn and having it contribute to my graduation which is the fattest W ever. A big part of enjoyment is not only becoming
      literate in how websites (something I to be honest use a lot) are designed and function (lowkey I appreciate and inspectElement websites for fun a lot more), but it gives you everything you need to actually start creatiing your own websites
      if not getting a front end dev job (which I'm not really concerned about yet ay my young free-spirited age :P). Websites are not only machinations of corporate industry (whatever that means) but tools we can use to express ourselves.
      This alone made not only the prospect of learning front end but actually programming front end to be a much more enjoyable experience. Being able to see your work in action really makes all the shitty debugging worth it, moreso than if
      you just do an anonymous lab for marks that nobody but your tutor cares about.

  <ReviewSection title="Effort">
    <p>
      I would estimate this course as taking around 5-10 hours of effort a week, and requiring 20 extra hours for assignment 3 and honestly 80ish hours (maybe spread around 2 weeks, there's no way you can get all this done in like three days straight) for assignment 4
      (shared between you and your partner). I don't want to think about how stupid and utterly frustrating my partner could be but if you decide to do it by yourself or get a partner you love and trust with all your heart then it will probably be much lower. You need a
      LOOOT of effort for assignment 4 and its a bit ridiculous which is why the rating for effort is MAXED out. However, this course is mostly pretty chill otherwise so I think it's pretty worth it. I would recommend starting assignment 4 as soon as its released (even though)
      it comes immediately after assignment 3 (which is farily hard work as well) is finished. The timing of assignment 3 is lowkey scuffed tho because that's around when midterms and other assignments are due, so maybe its all just a balancing game...

  <ReviewSection title="Delivery">
    <p>
      Phenomenal delivery. As stated above, content is delivered via bite-sized videos and supplemented with lectures, and this works really well for front end. I would normally watch the videos in 2x speed or merely read the slides to save time. A very small issue
      with this was that the slides, particular for some older recorded videos, weren't available or didn't match, but these were for some small parts only. I can't really comment on tutorials (noting there are no labs) because I didn't attend any... :P
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The one real frustrating issue with how this course was ran was that the backend we were given for assignment 4 had the worst documentation and routes known to man. For example, if you wanted to get data on a SINGLE game that one person made you couldn't have a route
      which gave only that data given the game's id or whatever - you had to find it from a bulk route returning ALL the user's games. That's honestly ridiculous as fuck and the backend was an utter travesty that was the only blemish on this otherwise spotless course.
    </p>
    <p>
      One really interesting thing of note is that the website is completely unique to COMP6080 and used to show you how you can build things immediately with the skills from COMP6080. I think that's pretty cool!
    </p>

  <ReviewSection title="Utility">
    <p>
      Once again, this course is incredibly worth the money for the amount of resources and skills you learn ($1 164 or around $130 per week excluding midterm break). It is also incredibly useful and I hope I was able to convey that in other sections. It is absolutely criminal
      that this course costs the same as the bastard course I did with it concurrently (<InTextLink link="/reviews/comp1521" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP1521</InTextLink>).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      On a side note, I was reading some course reviews about COMP6080 and these critics of COMP6080 are so fucking insane its unreal. Some people complain that HTML and CSS and vanilla Javascript have too much focus in the first few weeks when its a fucking
      intro course to web development and they're pretty much the only things about web development that we know are going to be consistent. Some people also complain that they don't teach modern React frameworks like Next - but frameworks are fucking frameworks and this
      course is impartial and isn't supposed to shill out one over the other, especially since some are notorious for being backed by certain companies. I think the focus instead on CSS frameworks like Bootstrap (a tiny bit outdated) and TailwindCSS (incredibly relevant) was
      a lot more essential to front end understanding. Some people have also criticised this course as not teaching anything new if you already knew frontend and those people are utter dumbasses its unreal. That's like complaining <InTextLink link="/reviews/comp1511" color="text-[#6029d6]">COMP1511</InTextLink> was too easy since you already knew C.
      This is an elective bozo. Fuck the haters...
