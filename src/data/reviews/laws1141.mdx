### Overview

Prerequisites: 24 UoC of LAWS courses

Admittedly, the subject matter of this course is inexorably boring as a whole, but with some incredible highlights. I understand why its necessary as an introduction to public law and the Constitution (and to be honest is quite useful understanding the history), but God. History is just so boring! This course is useful but not that fun or interesting. It's like a flu shot. I am quite indifferent to this course, and my emotions occasionally breached 'this is pretty interesting' but most of the time was plain indifference or boredom. You can enjoy in class discussions full of everyone spouting what they heard on the news, because you don't really need to understand that much theory in the readings to make relevant contributions, and you can enjoy special snowflakes repeating on the implied freedom of political communication like its their tic. Maybe it was a symptom of being in a big class, but there was a lot of depth in the readings, such as crazy stories about British history, that never really seem to get covered.

### Content

You first get introduced to public law under the guise of constitutionalism - what is a constitution, what is it supposed to achieve, and in what ways can a constitution exist, written or unwritten, flexible to change or rigid, disputes about power left to the people or the judiciary? But then you get into this intensely theoretical discussion about the 'formal' vs 'substantiative' conceptions of the rule of law and Parliamentary sovereignty (is it law because it obeys the process of law making or do you need to look at its content?) and it starts to become an absolute snoozefest full of pretty dense theory. The separation of powers is a nice reprieve before you dive into how the Australian Constituion waas influenced by the UK's system of having a lot of conventions and a Parliament with an Executive branch accountable to it, with the US' system of judicial review, federation, and a more strict separation of powers. 

It is these first three weeks that are by far the most boring and dreadful - enjoy learning about the Magna Carta and Bill of Rights and Act of Settlement, and the intricacies behind whether Parliament is truly sovereign or whether judges and the common law play a role, or the role of conventions. If you're interested in these things, more power to you, but I was not, and it felt quite dreadful. At least when it came to the American Constitution, watching Hamilton a long time ago made things much easier to click into place and I was able to joke about it. But the content of this part of the course is intensely theoretical and vehement on political theory and the proper distribution of power without any real case study of how it is applied. Important for understanding the Constituion, yes, but also quite tedious and painful to get through.

The boredom continues with learning about how Australia slowly cut legal ties from the United Kingdom, from federation to the Australia Act. At least here we get a mention of actual cases, albeit not turning on their facts and application more than the jurisprudence in the reasons. There is also a lot more theory about whether there is, if any, a convincing justification for why people obey the Constitution as vallid, until you realise people don't really think about it that much and there is, to put it quite meta-ly, no real answer.

It gets a little more interesting and vivid when you learn about how Indigenous people were recognised in the Constitution, and whether any notions of their sovereignty can play well with the Constitution. This is the second time visiting Mabo after <CourseLink course="LAWS1052" /> and it is a lot more interesting, especially once its actually explained with context and subsequent decisions that it did no more than recognise some specific rights of pre-colonisation Indigenous customary law, with all other instances of sovereignty somewhat extinguished. There is then talk of the 1967 referendum which allowed indigenous people to be formally counted in 'reckoning the numbers' and be within the scope of the 'races' power (hopefully beneficially). And you can't mention Indigenous people in this contemporary climate without talking about the Uluru Statement of the Heart and the 2023 Voice referendum, which I make no comment on.

Once you get to seeing the actual cases again, where there are legal disputes that matter, the course becomes a lot more interesting. You basically take the next three weeks talking about each of the legislative, executive, and judiciary, in terms of their power, their appointment, and their accountability. The peak of this course is when you learn about statutory interpretation and it is these three weeks I will sing the most praises about.

First, with the legislature, you unfortunately get an absolute snoozefest learning about the history of the Parliament in the United Kingdom. However, this section gets bonus points for mentioning the Witenagemot, which I approve as a CK3 player. Legislative power is quite straightforward (just being the powers enumerated in sections 51 and 52 of the Constituion), but this course starts to lock in when you get to learning about being eligible for joining Parliament under section 44. While there are five 'limbs', here you focus on two: having an 'office of profit' under the Crown (another instance of the separation of powers), for example even if you are a State public school teacher who takes leave, or if you're a citizen of a foreign power. Both limbs are incredibly interesting (and it is kind of a prelude to interpreting the Constitution), with quite memorable facts for the cases you explore. Learning about Re Canavan, which is quite an underrated but politically relevant case, was quite peak.

This course constinues its streak of genuinely interesting diamonds in the rough on the slot machine with the express and implied rights to vote, which is basically the underrated cousin of the implied freedom of political communication. The reasoning here is very interesting and the cases are pretty memorable (eg trying to take away the vote from prisoners, or removing grace periods for registering on the electoral role) and probably my favourite section, since you also actually get to read cases again.

You also casually learn about state legislative power, and how State legislatures have plenary power over everything else, so its quite fun although a bit irrelevant and with less interesting cases.

You can feel the vibe shift with statutory interpretation when the textbook transitions, and you finally get to apply the law to the facts again (it took five weeks to get there, and it was not that worth it, but still fun)! You have the classic combination of text, context, and purpose, and you also learn about the principle of legality, a fun little principle which is not hard to understand but pretty fun to apply and argue about. Though there is still some theory as to why it is permissible that courts interpret statutes in this way, or why the principle of legality exists, the theory here is much more interesting since you also get to apply it as well! Probably the best part and peak of the course, but there still interesting things to come.

With the executive branch, here comes another snoozefest as you learn about executive power and the 'royal prerogative', which unfortunately even as a CK3 player I was not interested in, and though there are definitely case studies, they involve less application to facts and more theoretical justifications, which makes them less interesting. You learn about the dismissal of Gough Whitlam, a classic that you can have fun arguing about when you beg for CP scraps, and the Egan cases, which strangely you got a glimpse of when discussing confidentiality and legal professional privilege in <CourseLink course="LAWS1230" /> but otherwise didn't mean much. The course troughs a bit when you learn about how the executive is held accountable through Parliament, judicial review, tribunals, the public (elections, whistleblowers, freedom of information requests), and the integrity branch (Ombudsman, different Commissions) but this feels like the most cursory Legal Studies level stuff which isn't really that interesting. This is one of the rare moments where I skipped the readings and it was just too general and boring (felt like reading a Wikipedia article).

Luckily, the intense legal principles and reasoning comes back when you learn about the judiciary. You learn about how judges are appointed, and the current ones on the High Court (which we should all know as members of the High Court Fan Club), and how they could potentially be held accountable on 'the ground of proven misbehaviour or incapacity'. But the real interesting stuff comes with trying to define judicial power (especially when it can be enforced on its own accord), and honestly the quite interesting and well-written judgment of the Boilermakers case, with some talk of the Kable doctrine in state courts (but states otherwise having no strict separation of judicial power). This theme extends itself when you learn about the persona designata rule (that a judge can still be appointed a member of executive if in their personal capacity, unless it undermines public confidence in their impartiality or status as a judge), which actually has a lot of interesting cases about issuing warrants for police interception, or sitting on the head of a tribunal, or preparing a policy report on conserving heritage sites. This is by far the most underrated and sadly rarely tested part of the course, since it is quite dense and interesting but almost never appears in a problem question or essay. If you had to ask me, putting this stuff into a statutory interpretation question, while it would be extremely hard, would also be extremely interesting.

The final few classes are a nice reprieve as you basically learn nothing you didn't learn by accretion and osmosis - how human rights are (or are not) protected by the Constitution, and how the constitution can be changed. The referendums are a bit boring as a massive history digest, but the doctrines surroudning how states change their constitution, including by impliedly repealing parts of it, and how imposing manner and form requirements conflicts with Parliamentary sovereignty, is also another underappreciated part of the course.

Overall, the most fun you will have with this course is statutory interpretation, learning about how people are eligible to run in elections, the right to vote, and how the separation of judicial power manifests in various themes. But the rest of this course, either being a massive digest of various examples which are all information overload and quite tedious, or incredibly dense political theory with no application of law to facts but abstract notions of how power should be distributed, will make you sleep, at least for me.

### Assessment

You have good old 20% class participation, a 30% timed online mid-term exam, and a 60% final exam split into one statutory interpretation problem question and a essay in response to one of three given questions.

The class participation, like always, still being a course the lectures call 'introductory' and where you get joked about for being young, is going to be annoying when people put their hand up to say stuff and talk for three minutes straight and we end up skipping important content so they can talk about what they saw on the news. Thankfully, I have learned inner peace and understand that it is more important other students engage with the content meaningfully rather than I, siting on my high horse, knowing everything, and looking down from my high tower (still on my high horse), feel just a tiny bit inconvenienced. Therefore, my snark is directed towards the people in the front row who contribute a lot but have nothing important to say, at the expense of acknowledging the forty other people in this class who want to have a go. Fuck you people! I really felt bad about how other people were so annoyed by the people in front (its a metaphor, they didn't have to be in the literal front), but after listening to how they would dominate, I understand and will now hate on that genre of person forevermore.

The problem with class participation here is that it is probably too high, especially with so many people in a potential class (I had 55 FUCKING people! Lowkey an administrative error) and with such dry content. Perhaps more time should've been spent on the more engaging parts mentioned earlier where you can apply the law (so that the more top students can contribute more nuanced takes, but there's still room for the simpler people in the front to say their simple things), but of course those 'people in the front' were just so interested in the formal vs substantiative conceptions of the rule of law... just remembering it is giving me flashbacks and making me frustrated so I don't want to.

I didn't really speak in this class because it was hard not getting dominated. Alpha cucks, beta bucks. But I honestly met some nice people so its fine.

The timed mid-term exam is beautiful. Never have I felt so carefree and joyful about an exam in my life. It opens for a week, but is only in the browser and lasts 90 minutes, so (though you're still not supposed to talk to people) you don't have the hassle of printing notes and can just use your online notes or the textbook copy (well deserved since there were some pretty niche questions about random scholars that were quoted exactly one time in a super theoretical part of the content). You're given two questions in a random bank, and its geared towards the first three weeks of content (basically the super dense theory stuff, with some indigenous people content thrown in). I went crazy for someone that started the exam at 11 pm after attending night classes. 

The final exam is also pretty standard. Once again, the problem question becomes quite easy when you practice since they always seem to repeat the principle of legality and freedom of speech combination. The essay is also pretty fair and not that noteworthy, although it might actually be quite hard thinking about how to answer in a balanced way given the range of things to talk about. 

If anything, I think the assessment structure is actually quite flawed, since some things are tested more than they are worth while others are completely left in the dust (eg the separation of judicial power, persona designata, state constitutions).

### Difficulty

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.difficulty} />

This course is not that difficult, at least to understand. But it is definitely difficult... to read. Quite boring in some parts.

### Enjoyment

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.enjoyment} />

Middle of the road in terms of enjoyment. Some really interesting parts mixed with absolute snoozefests.

</ReviewSection>

<ReviewSection>

### Effort

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.effort} />

There are online modules but they're not that difficult. Honestly, not much effort was needed to keep up, since though there was some reading, it still averaged around mid 20 to 30 pages. There are some lessons where you read entire chapters, and those are by far the most annoying and tedious, however.

### Delivery

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.delivery} />

My lecturer was pretty nice but constantly behind by about half a lesson which was quite annoying, although you couldn't blame them given the massive class sizes. There are some online modules as well, but they're not that noteworthy and just reinforce what you've learned, to be honest. I think this course, personally, has too much theory, and though I describe the readings as dense, the theory parts are perhaps more accurately described as bloated, because there's actually not that much substance, just so much reading. That is, unless you think random details about British history is 'substance'. The content in this course, if anything, made me actively appreciate law subjects that let you do problem question after problem question. I am an addict.

One other problem was that often what we went through in class didn't really reflect the detail of things in the readings - for example, never touching on all the British history we had to read, whcih was quite sad.

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

Where this course shines is actually how useful it is in understanding how the Australian Constitution actually works, why it was made in that way, why people respect it, and how it works to distribute and limit power. Now you know the language to sound like an armchair political theorist, except this time you actually know what you're talking about.
