### Overview

Prerequisites: <CourseLink course="COMP2511" />

Happy New Year.

This course is fucking garbage holy shit. I don't even want to think about this course. What a mistake and what a regret. I have never felt so ashamed of myself for swallowing this shit when the signs were obvious from the very start: forced group project, constant psuedo-substance industry talk, 'project-based' learning, dogshit tutor teaching skills, less effort than online tutorials, full of international students who take it only because there's no final exam, mandatory attendance but no impact, useless lectures, no other resources, groups with random people who aren't passionate at all. This course is limbo where the spririt of computer programming comes to be suffocated alive by the cold rough hands of the money churning conveyer belt rat race that is university without academic interest.

Is this the lowest course in my transcript by far? Yes. Did I hate every single contact hour and fake smile with my shitty group members and fake interest in my tutor and frustration and stress doing this shitty project last minute and being gaslit at the project proposal while every else half asses everything with AI? Yes, who cares, this course wasn't for me and I regret taking it. This course is like the fake degree shit that no domestic student does and only internationals with time to waste and fat pockets do so that on paper their transcript gets filled out. This is the kind of course that feels like it only exists to leave a paper trail - there is no substance or thought or interest. It feels so soulless to the point reality is more optimistic than the environment this court portrays. FUCK this course.

The saddest part is that I was really keen on the course at the start - wow you get to learn about Unreal Engine! And to be honest the novelty factor kept me even though I saw the signs of something very potentially frustrating (mandatory tutorials and randomly selected groups where nobody was really a domestic student). But as I talked about the course and saw how most people kind of dismissed the course, especially some of my friends, I really wanted to prove them wrong. But they were right. Really any other elective would've been better than this dogshit.

What are the worst things about this course? Let's go point by point!

First, you are given the most useless degenerate procrastinating bunch of group members in the world. I would honestly prefer if we could do it all ourselves. I can definitely see this course blossom with the right people, but since I knew nobody (or people otherwise kinda bailed) it was so stressful when we would delegate parts to people and they didn't do it. The way this course is structured as a massive group project but with a requirement for modularity means you have to break up your 'game' into smaller subsystems for individual people so that they can be worked on simultaneously, before splitting off to be able to work on our own parts which the majority of marks came from (eg my group was supposed to make a sample level before moving on to our individual levels). But you just know that by Week 8 nobody did shit and I was rushing creating an entire sample level by myself (why didn't I start earlier? Because we had a fucking REPORT to do before we could actually start our game, are you SERIOUS? And combined with procrastination and flex week, it was just over). And when some of my other group members did some more useful stuff like making a camera movement subsystem of course they were super coy about it and didn't want to share. I suppose it was just bad luck that I got a really shit group and that tainted my experience, but what separates other courses with group work is that since the workload is so immense, not even me (kind of a GOAT) could solo carry, compared to something like <CourseLink course="COMP1531" />. There was no lack of trust in this group and it hurt so bad.

Second, part of the reason why this course feels so colosally suffocating is the scope is so huge you can kill yourself if you are a perfectionist (ie basically most programmers). Its true that creating a video game from scratch and actually have it be something you're proud of means you have to becomes effectively a master of everything. Tell me why I had to learn everything about materials, textures, animations and rigging, nuances in Blueprint coding, camera tracing, physics, collision, controls and inputs, modelling, rendering using the god-awful sickly looking lighting systems that make every turn of the head look like pins and needles after effects, just to make a shitty game that nobody in my group except me cared about. It's so hard to be passionate when you're stuck with a group you don't actually like nor who don't put in any effort, PLUS having an endless sea of things to learn. There is no fucking reason given this amount of stuff that we need to spend the first four weeks on a fucking REPORT and a PRESENTATION (although I'm jumping ahead). 

It doesn't help that the course resources are absolutely dogshit (and thirdly) - an absolute insult that the only thing available are barebones slides where the only thing explained is the bare minimum and then segues into literally fucking irrelevant circlejerking sessions about VR, 'industry experience', and Unity, the tutor fucking has a schizophrenic stuttering ramble to themselves with their back turned trying to talk about literally nothing in the humid basement of failed academic dreams that is the VR Moog Lab (since everyone is international and nobody pays attention to when they speak). Enjoy a PDF written with the classic gloss of ChatGPT about how to resolve rendering issues from the course staff on the forums, or how to shitly use version control systems to work simultaneously teammates (which we could never get working and ended up just using FUCKING OneDrive). I will try so hard not to insult the lecturer and tutor personally, but I looked into their backgrounds a bit and they know nothing about game development, they're just random software or human computer interaction people. That makes a lot of sense. A course about game development from people who have nothing in connection with game development. Fucking kill me.

Fourth, the course is structured like absolute shit and reeks of the kind of fake teamwork collaboration experiential learning shit you would see from a degree whose sole purpose is to be six units towards a degree for people who see university as nothing more than a way to get accreditation for employment (what I, as someone who hasn't done commerce, think it sounds like based on the way other people have described the worst parts of it to me). I don't want to debate the honest truth that university is supposed to, and is for me, much more than just a piece of paper, but these kinds of courses definitely make it feel that way. Why do we have MANDATORY TUTORIALS with ATTENDANCE when we don't even DO ANYTHING except LISTEN to SOMEONE WHO CAN'T TEACH rehash the lecture content? Why the fuck in a computer science course that isn't ethics do we need to write a fucking REPORT about a PROJECT PROPOSAL and then do a fucking PRESENTATION about it? A VIDEO GAME? When you think of the genuine glory days of fun programming subjects that are the mainstream core courses, and compare it with this dogshit, and especially with the history of this subject formerly being about something actually useful (low level graphics APIs), there feels like a bit of executive handwavey mismanagement here. Where is the money going? It feels like the staff do not respect students, especially when they heavily encourage us to say how much we love this course in myExperience so we can get more game courses. Respectfully, why the FUCK would we give these nobodies more funding if this is what they can give us?

I saw some strongly worded reviews online about this course recently and the main 'silver linings' people had were that the course was fun with their friends, learning blueprints was interesting, and that their tutor wasn't bad. Is that it? How FUN the course is with friends? No shit, they're your friends. You could have fun with them pissing on a dead bird in an alleyway. Seeing this course for what it is, objectively, and especially compared to the two other brilliant electives I had already taken (<CourseLink course="COMP6080" /> and <CourseLink course="COMP3891" />), it was such a waste of money and my biggest regret at university, honestly.

The one good thing this course has taught me is to go with my gut, be honest with myself, and stop fucking going with the flow with everything. Because the most insulting thing is the fact that I'm really more mad at myself, mad about how I stuck with this course when the signs swayed round and round right in front of my face. Useless. Die die die.

### Difficulty

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.difficulty} />

The content is not that difficult and to be honest blueprint coding is quite intuitive. But the sheer breadth of everything you have to learn BY YOURSELF hurts so bad. And added to a group that slowly kills and this course sure is difficult. It feels like being graded for peeling off the skin near your cut fingertips over and over.

### Enjoyment

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.enjoyment} />

The only saving grace is that this course allows you to put a lot of object-oriented programming shit (especially the publisher-subscriber stuff) from <CourseLink course="COMP2511" /> into practice and its quite interesting how everything fits together. And I could totally see myself making some games casually with the knowledge I learnt from this course to be fair. Blueprints (the custom coding engine that Unreal Engine uses, where you effectively connect nodes representing variables or functions together, rather than writing lines of code) was also pretty fun. But I really wonder whether it was worth it to get here.

### Effort

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.effort} />

So much fucking effort. Really. In a group I would be happy with this rating would probably be lower. But when you have to learn so much shit by yourself, you learn that there is no light in the end of the tunnel formed when you stare directly up though the mouth of the well you were born in and drawn to the swirly sky you will never reach. And it is so nonsensical to force us to waste our time writing a fucking report first. Tell me why we needed to copy s

### Delivery

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.delivery} />

I learned not to be complacent when I realised this was an elective (ie students CHOOSE to do this) and students PAY for this. Compared to what we put in there are zero course resources and no support unless you want the staff to regurgitate an AI answer for you.

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

Everything useful I learnt was self-learnt from online tutorials which actually taught me the joy of Unreal Engine and others. And tell me why they shift to teaching the most useless industry design shit and then Unity (which nobody pays attention to because its not reflected in the assessment structure). Useless.
