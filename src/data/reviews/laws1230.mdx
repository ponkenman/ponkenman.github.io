### Overview

Prerequisites: 24 UoC of LAWS courses

I wrote this review two hours after receiving my final marks, so these words are probably (read: definitely) dripping with resentment and disappointment in myself while attempting to maintain an air of neutrality and objectivity.

Ethics as a course is quite interesting and quite meta - you generally learn not only the law of lawyering (the solicitors' rules and barristers' rules, as well as how the legal profession is regulated through the uniform law) but the emotional and moral difficulties of having to make the 'right' ethical choice in ambiguous situations. Would you be able to defend a client you knew had actually performed some heinous violent crime like mass murder or rape on a niche point of legal principle? Would you be able to withstand pressure from partners in a corporate firm who doublethink themselves into billing in six-minute intervals and meet targets (thereby nudging people into rounding up) while having to suck up to monstrous corporate clients who can pick and choose whatever firm they care about? The main selling point of what makes this course interesting is how real-world and personal it is - having to not only reflect on but articulate your own strengths and weaknesses about how well you could potentially handle different situations, applying and then subverting the very theoretical justifications lawyers often use to justify their seeming indifference to anything but advancing their client's interests (I am a mere agent, I'm just following orders, competition is good, I follow the letter but not the spirit of the law). 

While I'm still staying positive, this course also manages to get into very difficult but interesting topics as well. It is always funny if not a bit harrowing to see the different cases where lawyers fuck up and are found guilty of professional misconduct eg a judge who lied about a speeding ticket and got thrown into disrepute forever, a partner who fakes timesheets to maintain a deer-in-headlights dwindling family law department in a commercial firm, someone who just straight up hates the law society and calls everyone dickheads. There are some very interesting and intellectually stimulating topics across evidence, equity, tort, and contract as well as the general regulatory scheme eg conflicts of interests, confidentiality, maintaining civil conduct, and so forth. The sheer breadth of this course is something to be proud of, and if it were a course that primarily focused on this (and constant problem questions) it could probably be a top tier course.

Where the subject starts to falter, in my opinion, is where they encourage us to 'self-reflect', read very theoretical articles, do case studies in group projects, and require us to be imaginative. I had no problem doing so - in fact it could potentially have been quite 'woke', similar to <CourseLink course="LAWS1021" /> - but the main structural problem is that such reflection often felt shallow, pretentious, and restrained because of the inherent fact such reflection was assessable. Just like, for example, perhaps having to disclose an intimate mental health problem to a law society to be admitted as a lawyer, so too does this course teeter on having to violate your own privacy in order to reflect. The inherent difficulty in having to reflect on interpersonal skills in a professional context is that it is ultimately part of who you are, and you would need to be the face of emotional maturity to be able to compartmentalise your own habits to the extent this course suggests you ought to. It is neither realistic nor practical to insist to mark students ie to numericise what is essentially their personality and identity, how outgoing and steadfast and strong they are at maintaining a backbone, how emotionally intelligent they are at talking about potentially taboo topics, how to navigate conflicts, how to resist their superiors, how to be charming, how to keep cool under pressure, how 'ethically imaginative' they are, and so on. This course breaks and toys with that expected professional line which can be quite stressful - it is not just that, for example, that you know what the right thing is, but do you have the charisma and mental fortitude to hold it out on your corporate masters? That is a big ask for people who haven't even been solicitors yet, and the range of both professional misconduct cases and other case studies show that even the most experienced lawyers suffer from this. This course indeed does a great job at introducing students to ethics - what may have been before seemingly a box-ticking exercise - but it is less enjoyable or worth learning when you are stressed out in having to be assessed for it. I had no problem with the problem questions which made us critique others' behaviour, and indeed even considering what we would do in the situation, being aware of own disablers, was quite fun. But crossing that barrier and making it assessable makes talk of environmental pressure as a disabler seem hypocritical.

This course has so many assignments and requires such consistent effort for relatively little payoff that it was honestly a bit exhausting trying to be on top of everything. You have a group presentation worth 20%, class participation worth 20%, a final take-home exam worth 45% (which admittedly I left to last minute when I should've done it earlier and probably would have performed much better if not) and an experiential learning report (at a legal centre that you take on a certain night during the term) worth 15%. Trying to be on top of everything here PLUS having to do weekly online modules and post on the forum is crazy and this workload is quite substantial, which I talk about in later sections. What felt disappointing this course, however, was that there was no real payoff in actually putting in effort, I felt, since going beyond the readings (which my lecturer hinted was required to do well) often wasn't necessary at all and bore zero relevance to things in class. There was a bit of incoherence between the readings (which were broken into two parts - mandatory and recommended, a kind of thing I've hated since first introduced in <CourseLink course="LAWS1061" />) since sometimes it usually felt you had to come to class to figure out what was important, and sometimes our lecturer would directly contradict some of the readings (eg a case about writing a firm accusation to someone as within the standard of professional civility if it did no more than fairly advance a client's interests being taught to us as if you could never accuse someone ever without facing disciplinary action). Another contradiction was that sometimes there would be cases that were required reading that would straight up just not be covered eg Foreman's case in the secondish week of term, which turned out to be something also subject to a group presentation. There was also far too much reading compared to what was covered in class - it never felt like what we read was actually reinforced in lectures, and in fact they appeared completely irrelevant apart from putting citations in your final exam. I unfortunately didn't do too well in the report or the final exam because of my shitty time management at time (it's a learning experience), and I can fairly say that it would've otherwise been quite an interesting assignment/exam (as long as you remember to be specific and careful - something I didn't have the opportunity after a couple all-nighters to do). However, leaving that aside, having mandatory forum participation to do well in class participation (something that I've never experienced in other subjects and was honestly quite annoying), and to top it off having groups that you need to sit with the entire term and do a report/activites with, felt like the perfect tedious cherry on top.

All in all, I appreciate what this course is trying to do and I really think it is quite important and useful. The content has potential to be really interesting and its quite worth it to encourage students to be self-reflective. But I find that even with those good intentions, and often the effort the more emotionally terse need to put in, the course is far too much effort for relatively little payoff or satisfaction, making this course quite dreadful. It may also be that this course always has timeslots from 9-4pm and I'm more of a 4pm afterwards person, so maybe the timeslots had something to do with it. My overall evaluation is that this course deserves a 'B' rank as even though it really is quite exhausting and like having to sprint for an entire marathon, ethics really is quite underrated and interesting (especially disciplinary hearings, the trust money and other professional rules, and the different sources of law of both statute, contract, equity, etc).

### Difficulty

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.difficulty} />

This course seems difficult at first especially when you are introduced to so much theory about the lawyer's place in society, their 'standard conception of morality', different behavioural theorists' perspectives, talk of enablers and disablers at both personal and environmental (and even professional) levels, on top of different case studies and having to learn the actual law as well. But, broken down, the ideas presented are actually quite easy to comprehend. There is just so many. The only time this course really veers into something difficult to comprehend is when it comes to conflicting loyalties and conflicts of interest, as well as perhaps dealing with trust money, but those are quite standard. Overall, however, I can't in honesty say that a grievance I had with this course was that it was too difficult.

### Enjoyment

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.enjoyment} />

This course isn't really that enjoyable apart from when the problem questions really start to spike (around when you examine trust money, professional civility standards, conflicts of interest, and confidentiality). Before that, it feels really abstract and wishy washy since it seems nothing you really learn matters until you're actually in practice and the readings feature very little, if any, cases. Coupled that you had to sit with a group you need to micromanage and make fake pleasantries with instead of people you actually enjoyed the company of (although to be honest you could've had your friends in your group if you chose well enough, I just took an L), I honestly dreaded having to go to class and really considered skipping. My lecturer was quite engaging, down-to-earth and friendly, and used a lot of engaging and relatable examples, managed discussions well, and were encouraging, but even then they could not save this subject from its crushing workload, relatively dry content (followed by oases of genuinely interesting consequences of the lawyer as a fiduciary of their client, something I was only briefly introduced to in earlier private laws subjects but was not innately familiar with yet, not having done equity in <CourseLink course="LAWS2385" /> yet), and sheer dread about your career. Perhaps the underlying reason why this course wasn't enjoyable for me was it really dispelled any fleeting secret hopes of me being a lawyer anytime soon or ever - the sheer professional standards placed on lawyers combined with the competition, the low IQ answers from your classmates showing that they aren't really getting it, how even if you think you get it you still won't make it anywhere, the KLC placement making me aware of how abysmal the legal system really is at helping the disadvantaged who may need it most (while some people see people's perseverance through hard times as uplifting for them, I find it quite draining and it makes me more jaded and cynical), the final take-home exam being sandwiched between pretty intense assignments/exams and so me having to do my first all nighters for them instead of doing them early. I met some pretty cool people in this course, but that won't save this course from being really dry, draining, and ultimately enjoyable.

### Effort

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.effort} />

As I was taking it I found this course was quite chill, but on reflection I was just too busy to realise how busy it was. You are required to do: substantial reading per class, usually up to 30-40 pages across several articles/cases (although sometimes the readings would be shared with the modules, which really helped later in the term), weekly online modules, class participation in class and on the forum (which was often a rat race because, since the nature of ethics was so situational, people could really just half ass it by talking about their opinions without really relating to any readings) ON TOP OF a group project/presentation due in the second half of term where you articulate the ethics behind a certain case (I did the Crown Casino's antics that were investigated by the FInkelstein Royal Commission which was quite fun), an experiential report where you visit Kingsford Legal Centre for a night and then report on any ethical difficulties and your overall experience, as well as a final take-home exam comprised of a problem question and another question where you perform a more ethical/behavioural study of what went wrong and how to improve. This was by far the most reading I've ever done for a course - and the worst thing of all, it wasn't even paid off or worth it to do it on time since it never really came up (and if it did our lecturer would spoonfeed us it rather than letting us flex, which I found quite sad). In fact, this was the first law course I did where I straight up just did not make notes and just coasted off brief dotpoints because it really was completely irrelevant to what we did in class, which was quite tragic though. This was the wrong choice if you want to game rather than challenge the system but I really didn't mind. Compare that to the law course I was taking concurrently, <CourseLink course="LAWS1022" />, which only featured class participation, a midterm assignment using the online sentencing modules, and an endterm exam - this was far more interesting because the readings paid off and were worth doing and the assessment structure was much more streamlined. This course on reflection is absolutely exhausting if you want to do good (think 80+), but its so designed such that you can be unconscious and never speak half the time and still past. I find it quite structurally unfair to make the assessment structure have so much breadth to make it easy to pass while at the same time, for those who want to 'excel', having them need to be on their constant and persistent top performance for ten weeks straight. 

I would also take the time to note that the effort is made worse by having to micromanage group members and attend all these shitty meetings and standups where everyone agrees but nothing gets done. You don't just have a group for the presentation - it is for your entire term, and you also get to evaluate part of your group members' class participation, which is super exhausting especially if you find your group members hard to work with. I honestly was not looking forward to start ethics at 2pm and have to buddy up with some of my group members (although some others were really easy to work with and nice). That contributes to the effort. Usually a course with groupwork would recognise how emotionally exhausting it is and therefore either focus on it to ease up on the workload (eg <CourseLink course="COMP1531" />) or make it for only part of an assessment (eg <CourseLink course="COMP6080" />, or <CourseLink course="COMP2511" />). But this course having us be part of a group for ten weeks really felt exhausting.

I'm overloading this entire year because I'm a masochistic psychopath, but even then, I really recommend doing this course if you have other relatively chill courses because you may well be spending most of your time on this if you want to do well. My other courses did not fit this description (in order of most to least effort: <CourseLink course="COMP3891" />, <CourseLink course="COMP2511" />, <CourseLink course="LAWS1022" />). If I knew what I knew now about this course, I probably, however, would still do this course at this time, since <CourseLink course="LAWS1021" /> and <CourseLink course="LAWS1022" /> seem to be by far the lightest courses (and there is actually quite substantial overlap with this course).

### Delivery

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.delivery} />

My lecturer was fantastic as a person and I liked their consistent references to Better Call Saul throughout the term, but the overall content delivery is quite obscure for seemingly no reason. I always hated when courses obscure their content through the prism of required and mandatory readings PLUS online modules - it really makes you question whether what you're learning will be assessable, especially if you reference some case in the textbook that is never explained (looking at things like Porter v Dyer or the Australian Wheat Board case about claiming legal professional privilege, both of which seemed quite relevant to the exam), or the online modules which made mention of such random cases without every being corroborated in class. As a student, having to even question what is and is not part of the course (and thus having to search through all the 'canon' sources) made me feel half this course was purposefully made more obtuse to punish people who didn't do their readings but also did do them but thought they weren't relevant to anything in class. My main concern is basically that it should be clearer what is relevant and what is not - the broad net of 'everything is relevant' really weakens delivery when, in class, you skip over such important cases. I would identify this kind of fake scarcity of information to artificially drive up the difficulty of the course by checking who is doing the most detailed reading as a kind of subsidy over marking, which is really quite deceptive and manipulative if you think about it.

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

Even if this course wasn't the most enjoyable, nobody would ever say that this course isn't useful. If you want to be a lawyer it is by far the most helpful course you will ever take in terms of actually getting things done in day-to-day practice, setting up money in trust for clients, always being honest to the courts, being aware of the rules around claiming privilege and so on. It appears that another course (<CourseLink course="LAWS2371" />) revolves around a similar thing - so whether this course is as useful once I do that course remains to be seem. However, at the time of writing, it really orients your understanding of lawyers as professionals and how it fits within the fabric of society. 

Another more niche aspect of this course's utility is that it reveals to some extent what being a lawyer is really like, from the different (real and fictional) fact scenarios we are faced with. I can confidently say upon doing this course, unless I become more mature somehow in the next few years, that I probably will not become a lawyer - it is a far too competitive, adversarial, stressful, and overworked job with such unethical premises (eg billing by time) that it doesn't feel worth it. I'd still probably study law though, even if I knew this beforehand, since honestly law in itself is quite interesting.
