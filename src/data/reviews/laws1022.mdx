### Overview

Prerequisites: <CourseLink course="LAWS1021" />

A great course with a very interesting and thought-provoking but also easy to understand content, brief but memorable readings (cases) and a manageable workload. Continuing from the very theoretical (although still practical) prequel of <CourseLink course="LAWS1021" />, finally being able to play in the mud of understanding specific criminal offences and their normative justifications (assault, domestic violence, sexual assault, murder, manslaughter, general defences (including ones only applicable to murder), fraud/larceny and the variety of weird niche larcenies of plants and fences and cows or whatever, conspiracy, joint criminal enterprise and extended, and then accessorial liability) was great. On top of the in-class lessons, you also learn, primarily through online modules which can be completed at any time before the midterm is due, about the sentencing process - how judges decide the penalty to impose on someone found guilty of some provision (mostly criminal but sometimes civil) - and the various principles, sourced from statute (eg mitigating or aggravating factors, non-parole periods, maximum sentences) and the common law (eg parity, totality, the idea of 'instinctive synthesis'). This course provides a lot of necessary context to understanding some of the court proceedings someone might have observed in <CourseLink course="LAWS1021" /> eg the whole statutory scheme behind ADVOs and pre-trial diversion schemes for people who aren't fit to stand trial due to some mental health or cognitive impairment. It also reveals the current controversies in criminal law (eg the relationship between, for example, accessorial liability and constructive murder) which are very interesting.

It is quite chill and easy to do well in this course if you put in the effort (and of course apply good skills etc but you knew that already), especially since the teaching team are all pretty down-to-earth and approachable but still capable of giving interesting stories and really practical advice (especially my lecturer, an experienced solicitor at Legal Aid, which was very interesting). 

Assessment is comprised of 10% class participation (which takes the edge off somewhat), a 30% midterm sentencing assignment where you read and then criticise the shit out of (ie explaining the 'proper' approach of, or the prospects of appeal against, a fictional magistrate's reasons for imposing a certain sentence (where they usually make one trillion basic blunders which seriously questions their competency eg getting the maximum penalties of crimes wrong). This was a very creative and fun assignment (as fun as law assignments get) which not only showed how such principles applied in practice but also made the reality of how relevant the content was to the entire criminal process system. It is relatively stress-free as long as you start early, since the sentencing modules are quite lightweight and give you everything you need - you just need to be good at spotting everything the fictional magistrate does wrong (especially procedural ones eg not giving the earliest date for release, giving only a cursory mention to the purposes of sentencing), and then actually instruct what the magistrate should have done. 

Once the midterm is finished, the course is relatively relaxed up until the final exam, worth 60%, and in my offering (and also usually) comprised by a problem question and a small bite-sized essay addressing how well a particular offence/defence is at achieving its purpose (of being clear? Promoting justice and fairness? Addressing moral culpability? Things like that). I have accepted at this point that I am a full blown omega nerd so I find no shame in saying that I was honestly quite disappointed by how 'easy' or simple the final exam was (although I performed a bit below expectations and went way above the word count). Speaking of word count (1200 words and 800 words respectively), I found it quite unusual and honestly a bit stressful during the exam to have to chop down, since I found that there was quite a large amount of issues that needed to be addressed. 

The scenario was a homicide with two people where one had assaulted the victim earlier, and then the other inflicted the final blow - who would be responsible? This meant you needed to talk about murder, manslaughter (specifically by unlawful and dangerous act), perhaps other homicides like assaults causing death, possible defences eg whether intoxication denied mens rea or extreme provocation/self-defence, then complicity rules eg joint criminal enterprise, extended, and accessorial liability all together. I count about 8 topics there - to expect students to apply the rules to the specific facts and argue it well with only 250 words per topic is quite substantial especially where each usually has two-three steps that needed to be addressed. For example, for murder, why were the four heads of mens rea all not applicable? For manslaughter, why was the act both unlawful AND dangerous -> you had to conduct a 'trial within a trial' and consider whether the act was unlawful eg an assault. What about self-defence which involves two or debatably three steps: whether the response was (1) reasonable (2) by way of 'self-defence' in the (3) circumstances as perceived? For the complicity rules, was an agreement established? What was the scope/subject/crime that was agreed? If it fell out of that, was it nonetheless foreseeable? Many many issues and a very limited wordcount was quite weird. 

I call the scenario 'easy' or 'simple' because it was actually quite a predictable combination of subject areas, and there were some parts of the course that just straight up weren't tested (unless you count CP, I guess). I would've really liked to have been tested on larceny or fraud, since that had a surprising intersection with <CourseLink course="LAWS1150" /> but was super underrated in my opinion. Despite not really doing any past papers timed under practice or anything, I also managed to scrape by quite well (although not GOAT status). If I could redo this course again I would definitely do more practice to get in the habit of stating the principles more concisely so I could address everything I wanted.

On the other hand, the essay was quite chill and involved doing your best politician glazer impression by writing a recommendation to Parliament about the area in criminal requiring the most reform or attention. Although I did well in writing about the complicity rules and their interaction with constructive murder breeding shit law, I honestly regret (and maybe this is full nerd kicking in) writing about that rather than, for example, fraud/larceny and talking about possible incoherence in having to prove every single step, of which there were a lot of (eg the different tests for determining whether an act was 'dishonest' for different crimes depending on the completely arbitrary distinction of whether the offence was defined by the common law or in statute). I would've loved to go full nerd there... but honestly maybe it wouldn't be the right choice, given that you only had 800 words.

The only real negative about this course (or so some friends tell me), which is a bit inherent in its subject matter, is that it is the episodic sitcom equivalent of law courses where you learn about the 'crime(s) of the week' rather than everything feeling like learning about one big picture. In contrast with <CourseLink course="LAWS1075" />, for example, where you basically learn about the complete lifecycle of any claim to do with contracts, from construing terms at the start to breach in the middle to damages to rescission/termination from different vitiating factors in common law/equity in the end, with intersections with the ACL interspersed out where relevant, here the order of crimes almost seems random unless you really glaze over and see things as abstractly as possible. If I can briefly list out the order once again: assault, sexual assault, domestic violence, murder, manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, manslaughter by criminal negligence and other homicide offences, mental health and cognitive impairments (and the general diversionary scheme), automatism (denying you voluntary performed the act with your brain controlling your muscles/body), substantial impairment, intoxication, self-defence, extreme provocation, dishonesty and fraud, larceny, JCE and EJCE, accessorial liability, conspiracy. It does feel a bit random, with the closest this course gets to being 'cohesive' or 'complete' being the stretch from homicide to defences (although some of the defences apply to everything, not just murder). Going from extreme provocation to fraud is indeed quite the jump. 

Because each 'crime' just feels like learning about all the steps for each one, with none of the steps really overlapping or impacting any of the other steps (eg first find whether murder/manslaughter convictions are likely before considering defences), then maybe it can be hard to wrap your head around. However, it could be a benefit that all the topics are relatively self-contained since it could lead to more flexible reading (not that it matters to me, since they're all relatively light - enjoy 15ish pages on average with some crazy 30ish page ones for the dense topics of fraud, larceny, and complicity near the end).

Overall, minding that aside, this course is an amazing stress-free exploration and conclusion of the mandatory criminal law stream. I would honestly recommend strategically taking this course with other courses that have more dense workloads.

### Difficulty

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.difficulty} />

I make no exaggeration when I say this could be the easiest law course in the entire degree. All the 'crimes' are quite self-contained, all the elements of either offences or defences are like checklists that you just follow step by step (eg is there actus rea or mens rea?), of which there are usually only a few steps and analogous cases (or otherwise the applicable principles). This course only gets a bit complicated when you hit discussion of fraud and larceny, with their sheer amount of elements. Understanding how joint criminal enterprise, EJCE, and accessorial liability actually work might also be a bit tricky (eg to clarify, JCE and EJCE work to attribute the physical actus reus of a crime to another party, so a jury being unable to decide whether one party acted in self defence or not didn't automatically mean another party should be acquitted since it was a different inquiry into mens rea etc). As long as you have a solid understanding of what my lecturer called the N-word (normative) principles ie how crimes should ideally reflect moral culpability and benefit the public, how some defences operate as 'excuses' and others as 'justifications' and consequences flow from the corresponding implication on mens rea, then you'll be good!

### Enjoyment

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.enjoyment} />

Although I may have made the content of the course sound a bit formulaic or random, this area is ripe with very interesting discussions and scenarios/cases on whether someone should be held liable eg for borrowing a painting for it to be valued but then wanting to keep it for yourself, or withdrawing money from a joint bank account and putting it in your own, standing up to someone at a protest, texting your friend that you wanted to chop someone's index finger off together but then they go off and do it by themselves without you being aware. This made the course very enjoyable. The only negative is that sometimes I found there just weren't enough problem questions especially for some of the more abstract parts of the course eg when it came to mental health (or maybe I'm just a dickhead). I totally get why they decided to exclude explicitly testing for sexual assault or domestic violence though. There are also some times where they veer into the overall contextual approach to criminalisation discussed in the prequel course eg whether extreme provocation/self-defence is doing a good job for victims of domestic violence who 'snap' - this was interesting to discuss as well, although unlike <CourseLink course="LAWS1021" />, such discussion doesn't overstay its welcome.

### Effort

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.effort} />

This course has an incredibly light and flexible workload. You didn't need to learn any of the content until the final exam (if you didn't mind tanking your CP mark) since the midterm primarily testing the sentencing modules exclusively. Perhaps most of the effort is spent doing assignments etc.

### Delivery

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.delivery} />

Whenever I review a LAWS course this is pretty much an exclusive discussion of whether I liked the lecturer or not. The only things I was a bit annoyed by was that my lecturer often asked us more about our opinions/judgments on whether the law was effective as opposed to applying the law (I just wanted to flex, my bad). To be serious though, sometimes my lecturer would overexplain the memes they used (although they were quite proud when they used a meme they had created themselves rather than copying a random one off the internet) and spend more time on that than actually explaining the law, and sometimes they were a bit slow to articulate what a concept was (although to be honest, I totally would do that as well, and tbh they were really knowledgeable once we understood everything). They also did this thing that would stall and waste so much time (honestly 10-20 minutes each time) where they would try an invent an ambiguous factual scenario using students' names eg stealing a water bottle or being part of a group chat revolved around intimidating someone. When I felt them starting on that I honestly developed a habit of starting a ten minute chess game because I knew it wouldn't be done by the time I had (unfortunately) lost and ragequeued three more times.

Those nitpicks actually pale quite a lot, however, since my lecturer was otherwise super down-to-earth, friendly, and engaging, while making the law knowledgeable and acessible. Those are the things that make actually going to lectures worthwhile. On the other hand they also called me a nerd and a communist. :P

The overall textbook and online modules were also super clean (the same textbook as <CourseLink course="LAWS1021" />, actually). My only real issue was that sometimes there was stuff that needed further clarification (eg what does 'being satisfied no other penalty is appropriate' in deciding to imprison someone actually mean?) which sometimes also meant going a bit outside the course resources, but otherwise I really had no complaints. This course was also honestly quite similar to <CourseLink course="COMP3891" /> in that I found the convener super responsive to studnet questions about the sentencing modules on the forum.

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

This course finally makes you understand what they hell people mean when they say principal in the first degree, self-defence, or what sexual assault prosecutions are like. This course also removes a lot of mystery from what going to court actually feels like (ie the procedure for both summary and indictable offences). I don't know if this course will ever be useful in a career sense since I don't plan on going to jail, but you definitely learn a lot of relevant and useful shit.
