### Overview

Prerequisites: None

This course was incredible. You learn about set theory, number theory (particularly modular arithmetic), proofs and logic, combinatorics (including recurrence relations, for some odd reason), and graph theory. Discrete maths reminds me of linear algebra without any messy decimals. Once you have mastered the basic concepts, it is very fun to try and solve different problems. Almost any topic in here can be tied to any other topic through some creative problem or way of thinking. Want combinatorics in set theory? Find the amount of relations on a certain set which are both reflexive and antisymmetric, for example. Want number theory in graphs? Find the amount of edges in a graph defined such that two vertices have an edge only if they satisfy some congruence. This course was so interesting that I attended all the weekly tutorial sessions even though they were completely optional. It was actually quite fun discussing problems with people. I also kept getting glazed by my tutor who turned out to write some of the Maths Ext 2 HSC papers, so that was fun.


Like most first year maths courses, there are weekly lessons (this time with Numbas rather than Mobius + tutorial participation), an assignment, two lab tests, and a final exam. Everything is pretty chill as long as you do everything on time and its really just a good time all around :P

### Difficulty

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.difficulty} />

If you're not good at maths or abstract thinking, maybe you'll find this a little difficult... but without saying too much, I DIDN'T!


The hardest part of this course is probably counting correctly in combinatorics for some tricky inclusion-exclusion things OR some funky graph problems about planar and dual graphs. However if you attend the tutorials (where the questions are MUCH harder than anything you'll see in an exam) you'll be fine!

### Enjoyment

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.enjoyment} />

This was my favourite maths course (since MATH1241 still has calculus) and I voluntarily attended every tutorial because the content was so interesting (and also because it was immediately before my basically mandatory LAWS1150 class). When you get to think creatively it is like unlocking a new world. Shit is enjoyable af ngl

### Effort

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.effort} />

This course is so fucking chill its unreal. You really don't need to do much as long as you keep up with labs and lectures. To be honest if you're really (nerdy) hyped about shit like I was you can also just look at the lecture notes and do everything a week before. Maybe maximum 3-4 hours on a good day with some grinding before labs and exams, like other courses? The assignment is breezy and just requires some short proofs, don't worry about it!

### Delivery

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.delivery} />

I love how maths at UNSW is delivered. It's brilliant. It might seem like a lot of content, but having labs + lectures + tuts honestly really works well. Loved doing labs to get the basics down then going to tutorials and getting my mind blown by crazy problems.

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

This shit was only $555 TOTAL. $61 a fucking week. That's fucking insane and lowkey a fucking steal. Lowkey it was worth it even if I don't do anything with Maths ever again purely because of how enjoyable this shit was.
