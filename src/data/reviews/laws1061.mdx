### Overview

Prerequisites: <CourseLink course="LAWS1052" />

I wrote this part near the end of 2024 term 3.


This course is a step up from <CourseLink course="LAWS1052" /> but still very bare. You cover nuisance, negligence, breach of statutory duty, concurrent liability, and damages. Nuisance was very interesting and I loved looking at all the cases and drawing analogies. Yes, of course a land owner would be responsible for feral dogs causing havoc on their neighbour's property if they knew they were a nuisance and did nothing! Very fun to think about. There was also an overlap with negligence (omissions causing property damage) like that one case where someone's neighbour failed to put a fire out.


Then you learn about negligence (which is the bulk of this course). You first learn about the concept of the duty of care. However, I feel like this was conceptualised and explained in a far more difficult way than necessary. It is much easier to understand the duty of care when you already understand breach, but we spent so much time looking at different categories that it all started to feel like banging my head against the wall. This was especially problematic when we looked at the liability of an occupier for any entrant onto the property, since it was simultaneously explained as both an issue of 'the scope of duty of care' as well as whether the duty of care was breached. So which is it?


The time spent on the breach and causation felt rushed in comparison. Furthermore, the progression of the course 'broke down' as we eventually just started looking at the provisions of the Civil Liability Act for all the various defences. I don't think I remember seeing a single problem question in negligence. In fact, there was more of an emphasis on reading academic and scholarly articles, which I felt was poorly done. The articles were interesting, but I felt they weren't done justice, since we spent such little time talking about the philosophical points they raised and instead just crammed random tidbits into an exam only our marker would read at the end. We also looked at damages, which is also very very boring and dry. Nuisance and breach of statutory duty were by far my favourites, while trying to unpack the Civil Liability Act and dealing with whether any of the defences apply can be a headache. Don't do what I did and bring some flowcharts to help you! This was also the last law course I did where I chose a morning class, and was subsequently hounded by people I didn't like and failed to participate in class. Maybe that's why I am not too fond of this.


I wrote the rest of this on May 15, 2025.


Looking back, this was probably the worst course I've taken at UNSW (so far...), not in terms of the subject matter being boring or me not liking the people around me, but just how I felt coming into class and being there and doing everything. It was really just a mix of the worst factors possible: having a morning class that I felt groggy about (as well as a relatively shit job as a janitor), being too 'shy' to get to know the people around me (I remember those moments during mid-class breaks where I would just pretend to look busy), not feeling confident speaking up in class and thus not understanding shit despite reading all the readings, the course being structured so abysmally poorly, and also having a lecturer that to be honest wasn't the best. Looking back on it now with the hindsight of me actually potentially being somewhat good at law a little bit, this was a complete and utter travesty and such a waste of potential that I'll explore below. Tort law, especially negligence, deserves a better course. Although I'm being negative I still note that everything was alright, just not amazing... and once you experience actually exciting and inspiring courses, 'alright' looks and feels a lot like 'dogshit'.

### Difficulty

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.difficulty} />

The content in itself is actually quite difficult for a beginner course. Nuisance, duties of care for different kinds of injuries, breaches and causation, a breach of statutory duty, potential defences (contributory negligence, a voluntary assumption of risk, an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity which is quite a mouthful), vicarious liability and non-delegable duties. Having to rely on the Civil Liability Act is part of the difficulty because it adds an extra layer of complexity that you need to address in an answer. There's honestly a lot of subtlety and I feel like (like I did) it seems more difficult if you don't see the big picture. However this difficult might've been exacerbated by other issues which I'll talk about later.

### Enjoyment

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.enjoyment} />

This could have been enjoyable. Looking at the cases with hindsight, they're actually quite iconic and the facts are all actually quite distinct and interesting. It's just that I didn't enjoy it at the time. If I could redo this course as I am now, I would probably enjoy it quite a lot actually. The articles on the philosophy or principles behind tort law are also quite thought-provoking if sometimes a bit dry at first.

### Effort

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.effort} />

There is a surprising amount of reading for this course, with it regularly getting up to around 40 pages - a lot more than I initially expected, and actually more than some other subjects which cover more things (eg <CourseLink course="LAWS1150" /> or <CourseLink course="LAWS1075" />). Having to read both case law AND journal articles was an interesting choice. It might take you 3-4 hours, per lesson, especially if you aren't in tune with how to actually read for law yet like I was.

### Delivery

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.delivery} />

This is my biggest issue with this course. I genuinely think that this course is structured incredibly poorly, my lecturer felt shockingly below standard, and this course actually puts people off to law rather than easing them into studying it.


If I first start off by being fair. I understand that law is necessarily hard at first and that the average person really struggles with it... but, in my opinion, two factors suggest this is also likely to be an external ie a problem with delivery rather than an internal problem ie me just not being able to think clearly. Firstly is that, even as a matter of ego or foolish overconfidence, I recognise now that I am very very capable of understanding the law from other subjects (even within the private law sphere). Secondly is that I have the benefit of not only hindsight but documentary evidence ie presentation slides which corroborate my experiences. The general summary is that there was a perfect storm of shit factors that is really nobody's fault. My lecturer was a PhD student ie not a trained academic and not someone who had experience educating students (especially first years, when their minds are perhaps more 'vulnerable'). The quality of their slides was atrocious ie it would be paragraph after paragraph with no real guiding principles extracted nor clear summaries or explanations. They conceptually failed to link to the underlying principles behind negligence or a duty of care in the first place (ie an obligation imposed by law as a consequence of huamns interacting with each other in society and having reasonable expectations of being taken care of). I frequently reading the journal articles but them being discussed only cursorily. They used a lot of group work, which I liked (I could talk to people as long as we had some underlying task to talk about), but they were just completely and utterly shit at explanations and teaching. The slides were all over the place and littered with irrelevalant and distracting shit. It was the kind of stuff where if a student wrote that same style they would be told to be more precise. It wasn't their fault, and you could tell they were trying thier best. Their teaching just did not work to me (but maybe it worked for other people).


When you can't understand something and feel like its your fault, its just tragic and the worst feeling in the world. I was feeling like I wasn't good enough to be doing law (even though based on my conversations with other people in the class I was mostly getting along with the content well). The main reason was because our lecturer felt incredibly cliquey and showed favouritism a lot. It built a kind of subconscious ignonimy that prevented me from ever participating. It was like a public humiliation going into that class just having to endure it, and it really fucked over my confidence. They would also talk about shit that we hadn't even studied yet. What the fuck is a reversionary interest? (We would do this in LAWS1150). Also, why did they never explain the big picture of negligence in the first place? (Actually, I just remembered I missed the first two weeks and had to just read along and look at the slides... that's probably why).


I also remember the utter shitfights that were CP. They didn't know how to ignore students who were obviously 'baiting' for free CP by asking dumb as shit or obvious questions. I also don't understand why there were international students that could barely speak English here. I think I'm a tolerant person but it was just cringeworthy having to reel back in your seat listening to someone string together an on-the-spot translation for CP marks but know jack shit about the law. I feel guilt about this course now, a hidden and private kind of guilt that I don't think anybody else felt (and so nobody else can really relate to) caused by having to deal with such this shit teaching, but at the time I actually felt angry. So angry, that I vowed to just speak up in class without caring... and that's how I entered GOAT status...


Just off of this class alone, I'm thinking about updating this website to include notes about some law subjects just to show how the law really is quite accessible and easy to understand at least conceptually. I absolutely hate the feeling of being left in the dark not because you can't understand something but because someone isn't doing their job. What do we pay for... and this is the only course where I can barely remember what we did in it. It's like the 'trauma' of the situation is blacked out from my mind. I don't really remember a case or anything... and I actually had to look back at my notes to learn about what we were actually supposed to learn.

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

My main issue with this course was delivery. But, honestly, torts are actually quite interesting, and I just wish it was taught correctly. The things you learn about, for example, damages come back in other private law courses. Negligence is something quite important to know about, and liability in general (its quite popular), although nuisance and breach of statutory duty are more niche (still very enjoyable though).
