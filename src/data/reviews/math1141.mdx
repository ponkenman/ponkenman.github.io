### Overview

Prerequisites: None

A very chill introductory course to higher level maths. You learn a surprising amount of concepts here, but they were taught phenomenally. The content is split into algebra, which covers vectors, vector geometry, complex numbers, and matrices, and calculus, which covers limits, continuous functions, differentiation, integration, and curve sketching. Matrices and linear algebra absolutely blew me away. Very magical realisations. The calculus part was somewhat dry but still quite interesting, although at the start it is very 'abstract' (the epsilon delta whatever gets a special mention). This course was the first time I actually felt I was learning beyond a high school level. University level maths is a breath of fresh air compared to high school. Instead of rote memorisation, it really tests your understanding of abstract concepts and can link them together in very creative ways.

This review is pretty light (1) because there's not really that much to say (2) because I'm lazy and (3) because this course, to be honest, is largely overshadowed by <CourseLink course="MATH1241" />.

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

This course is largely overshadowed by <CourseLink course="MATH1141" /> in terms of learning about crazy shit... however its still quite worth it! Maybe this course has more utility in getting you introduced to university...
