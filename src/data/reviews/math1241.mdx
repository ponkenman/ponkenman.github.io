### Overview

Prerequisites: (Relevantly) 65 in <CourseLink course="MATH1141" />

In the algebra part of this course you learn about vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and probability. After doing this course I had the serious urge to switch my entire degree and just do linear algebra. Linear algebra is beautiful. Even though I probably will never use this information in my actual career, it is incredibly interesting and intellectually satisfying for all the jigsaw pieces to fall into place. Of course every single linear transformation is just a matrix multiplication! Of course you can find the general solution a linear recurrence relation using matrices! Absolutely brilliant. Probability was a let down in comparison. In the calculus component you learn about functions of several variables, more integration, ordinary differential equations, Taylor series, and the length of curves + surface areas. This was much more interesting than the calculus in MATH1141 , but still pretty abstract. However, any qualms I had about calculus were absolutely made up for by the algebra component. An insane course that genuinely changes the way you think about, not only maths, but problem solving and life in general!

### Difficulty

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.difficulty} />

Of the three maths courses I did in my first year, this was by far the trickiest. Everything is understandable but you really have to think creatively, especially for the algebra part. Even though I just got under a HD, I don't feel that bad about it (or looking back on it now I didn't really put that much effort into it). Some things kind of also get super abstract so you have to hold your breath and wait until you come out the other side.

### Enjoyment

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.enjoyment} />

Vector spaces and linear transformations are god level. Interesting af. Calculus was alright and probability was a bit of a let down. However the enjoyment is still up there overall.

### Effort

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.effort} />

It's your usual first year maths course (labs, assignment, weekly lessons, final exam) and is pretty chill (maybe around 3-4 hours max a week) until you get to the final exam, where you pretty much just binge past paper question banks all day to revise. Overall however its a pretty manageable amount of effort.

### Delivery

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.delivery} />

The lecturers were interesting and explained things well although they lokwey had heavy af accents. Just like other first year maths courses everything is presented brilliantly, especially the weekly lessons (which are super engaging). My tutor turned out to be one of the fucking lecturers in <CourseLink course="MATH1081" /> the next term which is crazy. After finishing the last Mobius lesson there was a Star Wars-esque farewell credits scene to all the people who presented solutions in the weekly lessons and I genuinely mentally although not physically teared up a little... it was poignant af but also really funny...

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

This course is worth taking just for the abstract thinking it unlocks inside you alone. The fact its so cheap at $555 total or around $60 per week is just an added bonus.
