### Overview

Prerequisites: <CourseLink course="LAWS1150" /> and <CourseLink course="LAWS1075" />

I was very scared at the reputation of this course. Ooh equity is so difficult and hard and scary ooh you're going to conceptually struggle with everything ooh its so obfuscated and mysterious and lurks in the shadows of the night and you'll take one trillion hours to study every night. But it turns out that equity, trusts, and (more generally) property law is actually pretty interesting. Are there a lot of cases? Yes but they're way less important individually and you never need to know the precise details of them as with other subjects - I feel you had to know more individual detail of the cases in contracts (<CourseLink course="LAWS1075" />) for example. Are there a lot of concepts? Yes but if you read everything and understand how everything liks together you'll be fine. I think part of the terror of doing 'difficult law subjects' is really just mediocre people trying to circlejerk themselves into feeling less insecure and more prestigous and special at the fact they're doing a 'law degree'. 

However this is definitely as difficult as a law degree can probably get. Summaries will not save you when you really have to understand to core reasoning behind a particular decision in a case. There is a lot of discretion and counterveiling considerations pointing everywhere at every stage so you really need experience from reading cases about what the most important factors tend to be. Some things are quite historical.

### Content

There really is a lot of content - I often felt what would have taken two lessons in previous courses in tort or contract would take up one or even half a lesson here. Of course you have your two hour seminars twice a week and a one hour online module, but the reading for this course is quite intense and oftentimes doesn't really pay off compared to what you actually do in class when you want to farm your CP points like a good little student. 

The very first week of equity is honestly completely irrelevant and just there to make you feel safe. You start with one lesson on the history of equity and the Judicature Acts and the idea of equitable maxims and equitable interests that honestly was so boring and theory prone that it reminded of the early days of <CourseLink course="LAWS1021" />. However it picks up and becomes much more interesting very fast. 

There's also your classic bars to relief - laches (delay to the point it disadvantages whoever you're suing), acquiescence (where you objectively consented so you can't sue), unclean hands (where you yourself did some fucked up shit), and hardship including to third parties. The word 'bar to relief' was thrown around so much so its good finally knowing its not that hard.

The first major topic is remedies - really what separates equity and makes it useful if you want to sue someone for some shit is that it has special rules that effectively mean assholes suffer more than they usually do. You look through how equity is all about conscience or the fairness of a situation for not only the plaintiff that's suing, but the defendant and even third parties they have adequate notice of. Unlike other areas of law where remedies seem to be as of right even if 'nominal' eg damages for tort or breach of contract, equitable remedies are 'discretionary' ie it depends on whether or not you're not a loser. It is far too general at the start in my opinion in terms of how they try to explain how different remedies serve different purposes but then it gets more interesting when you look at specific remedies. You do some remedies - specific performance (of a contract) and injunctions - in an online module near the start of term (which is honestly not that relevant apart from maybe a few sentences in your assignment) - before doing the bigger ones. To be honest though there's so much content for specific perforamnce and injunctions with relatively little payoff since it never really got tested. The first major remedy is an account of profits ie where you need to pay gains you made, with a discussion of allowances for people who put effort in etc. It's crazy how you can potentially have to give up years' worth of profits from a business. There's also equitable compensation, split into 'reparative' ie repairing for loss suffered from some equitable wrong, and 'substitutive' ie where you need to make good some property. Honestly this shit is quite academic but it always seemed like to me that reparative was for pretty much anything and substitutive compensation was only relevant where you held property in a fiduciary capacity like a trustee but whatever.

The next big topic is a study on fiduciary relationships and fiduciary duties/obligations (honestly theres so much academic discourse on even what the correct terminology is, whether it is 'relationship' or a 'duty' or an 'obligation' that I really couldn't give a shit). The general gist is that historically back when there were the courts of Chancery whose primary motivations were maintaining fairness in a situation in a religious kind of way, they saw that one person, the 'fiduciary' could be in a certain relationship or behaved in a way with another person, the 'principal' that basically meant the principal was completely helpless and reliant or expected the 'fiduciary' to act in their interests or otherwise the relationship would serve no purpose and have no function. The very first, staple relationship of this kind was the relationship between a trustee and their beneficiary - since the trustee was the legal owner and could hire agents and form contracts etc but committed themselves to holding property for the benefit of their beneficiaries, it would defeat the entire point of the relationship if trustees were allowed to ignore their beneficiary's interests and do whatever the fuck they wanted. There are definitely, apparently, 'policy' reasons for this (ie courts going 'you have been very naughty' but otherwise no real justification), so if the trustee did act in a way which fucked their beneficiary over, courts of equity were more willing to award special remedies and shit. Then courts realised that holding trustees to such strict standards because of vulnerability of the beneficiaries etc could apply to different relationships as well - for example, directors and a company, or partners in a partnership, or employees with their employer. And therefore the concept of a 'fiduciary' arose - and though you'll read so much shit about how hard it is to define a fiduciary it isn't really that hard. It really always refers to where someone becomes obliged by equity to have to act in the interests of another. Call it loyalty, trust and confidence, whatever, its really quite discretionary.

The simple dichotomy they want you to use in your assignment is that usually you first ask whether, for two people in a problem scenario, they're in a 'status' fiduciary relationship (ie trustee/beneficiary, agent/principal, etc). But being a fiduciary isn't actually about being in a 'status' relationship - its always dependent on the facts, and its just that some relationships are seen as so intrinsically fiduciary all of the time that it must always be (similar to in contract, terms implied in law). But you can still be a fiduciary, even if you're contracting parties, or even parties about to enter but never entering into a contract, etc. It's quite different to other areas of law where the relationship between people is quite certain.

There's a lot of academic debate you'll be exposed to about whether being a fiduciary is voluntary like a contract, or whether its imposed by law like negligence is, and if so whether its done because of 'objective' conduct or some other reasons. Its definitely not voluntary because you can be a fiduciary even if you purport to contract out of your obligations, and since sometimes you can be a fiduciary when you take steps to enter into a contract. It's quite interesting. I'm more inclined to the view that while it is something that is imposed after looking at the objective conduct and circumstances of the relationship between the parties, its not like a voluntary contract has no role to play, and for example, if the kind of obligations you have in a contract show wiggle room for self-interest its probably not fiduciary. But the reason for not imposing fiduciary duties isn't because you include some special exclusion clause but because based on the way you have wanted to define your relationship you mutually agree that there's no loyalty involved and no strings attached.

There's a lot of distinction and digression between British and Australian and other areas of law at this point, but at least in Australia, there are really only two 'fiduciary' obligations. A fiduciary is liable to their principal if they make a gain out of putting themselves in a position where their duty to the principal (actually or possibly) conflicts with their own or another's interests (the 'no conflict' rule) and a fiduciary needs to account ie give to their principal any gain they make through their position or capacity or by acting as or by using (its the same thing really) their position as trustee (the 'no profit' rule). And you learn about how the only real defence is informed consent, since you can't really 'contract out' of fiduciary obligations. This is by far much easier conceptually although try not to be too clever (am I still butthurt about the assignment, yes).

Next up you take a random segue into general property law by learning about the law of assignment - how to effectively transfer property from one person to another. You rehash the different kinds of property, real (land), chattels, 'choses in action' like contractual rights, 'equitable' property like an interest in a trust, and things that aren't actually property but look a lot like it (eg income you'll get in the future, you can't give something you don't have unless for example its the contractual right, the tree not the fruit, etc). It seems confusing but its actually quite straightforward. First, what's the way to transfer your kind of property legally (ie with no help from equity)? For example, transferring land by registring it in the Torrens system, or just handing over possession of a chattel with a clear intent. But if you haven't affected a legal transfer, that's okay, because equity in some circumstances will regard the transfer as complete even if you don't comply perfectly with the legal procedure. If you have a contract and consideration is given, you get whatever you wanted no matter what, even if it isn't property (like future income), because it 'binds the conscience' or whatever, so upon receipt of the property, it is held on 'constructive trust' (ie basically 'for') you, basically meaning you successfully have an equitable interest in the property. If there's no consideration, then the person who wanted to donate the property to you needs to have done everything in their power to effect a legal transfer such that its out of their hands (eg waiting for the company secretary to register your share transfer). If its equitable property (and thus no way to legally assign it), you can do whatever you want as long as there's a clear intention to assign. And don't forget when you want to assign a portion of a chose in action, there's no legal method so just pretend its equitable. And don't forget that if it doesn't comply with formalities your transfer has no effect at all. Maybe this wasn't helpful but I honestly think its quite chill once you understand it.

You then dive deep into trusts in the second half of the course. You look at what a trust is and how to differentiate it from other relationships. It's basically a relationship between property, a holder of property, and beneficiary or class of (or a charitable purpose), where the 'trustee' who holds the property holds it and deals with it for the benefit of, or along the terms of the trust. You learn about the three certainties required for equity to recognise that a trust exists and is enforceable - that the settlor wanted to create a trust, that the subject matter property is ascertainable, and the beneficiaries are as well, with the different tests for each one. There are formalities. Assignment also is a bit relevant because sometimes if the settlor transfers property to someone else to act as trustee, you'll need to know whether that assignment was valid as well. I think this was by far the more straightforward part of the course and felt a lot like contract. In fact, when you learn about Quistclose trusts, some contract knowledge is relevant as well.

You learn that trustees have over the case law a trillion duties particular to being a trustee - adhere to the terms of the trust, 'get in' (ie acquire and maintain custody of) the trust property, keep your property separate from your own and others, keep and render trust accounts, inform beneficiaries of their entitlements if necessary, give trust documents but not reasons revealing private deliberations and discretions that should be confidential, act with reasonable care, act impartially so as not to discriminate between beneficiaries if not permitted, act personally ie they can't really delegate their job or act under dictation, consider the exercise of powers that are given to them by the trust instrument, their fiduciary obligations, their inability to purchase trust property (but they can purchase the equitable interest of beneficiaries in the trust property for some reason). You also learn about trustee 'powers' and how courts don't really intervene to review power unless they did so improperly eg for the completely wrong purpose or because they didn't care. I'll be honest, there was so much content for this ONE lesson in particular that it was insane. Did I mention the online module where you learn about the legislation and powers of investment as well?

Then you learn about how a trustee has a right to indemnity - a right to pay expenses incurred using the trust assets themselves ('exoneration') or where they pay it personally and then seek compensation from the trust property ('recoupment'). Trustees' roles are pretty complicated so they get to ask the court for advice and courts are usually pretty generious about giving it. There's also quite difficult rules about how actually a beneificary has a right to call for the trust property even if it is explicitly against the terms of the trust, but it gets more difficult when there's multiple beneficiaries and only one of them calls for it, etc. Then you learn how to vary or amend a trust (and this is super niche and its just sad it didn't really pay off to learn about this since we never talked about it).

Honestly I'm getting pretty tired recounting all of this but I'll continue. There really is so much content which is why the difficulty is maxxed out - genuinely feels like you're drowning sometimes. A breach of trust is basically whenever a trustee breaches their duty, and there's some statutory defences, exculpation clauses, and some remedies particular to trustees eg a court appointing a new one.

Honestly express trusts are quite a behemoth concept and I'm glad we're over it now. Next you learn about (and now its around week 7) accessorial liability for a breach of trust/breach of fidcuiary duty where it turns out a person who knowingly receives property or assists in such a breach with also be liable. It is raelly fault based, and knowing all the knowledge requirements is a little crazy, but they're all quite straightforward. If you understand that underlying all of this is that a person needs to be at 'fault' to be liable, that is. There's also some sprinkles of 'unjust enrichment' sprinkled through this as you learn about some other categories and it gets super academic but for no real reason since its never discussed nor brought up.

Our second random segue foray into the law of property is when we deal with the rules of tracing - when you have some interest in an asset, and someone takes your asset and substitutes it with another (eg selling it, bartering), you can choose to vindicate your interest by claiming the substitute instead. This is like some alchemy shit and its very interesting how all the rules are essentially 'we assume the worst of wrongdoers'.

The course concludes with resulting trusts (trusts where a difference between purchase price and legal title means it is 'presumed' but can be rebutted that the property is declared on trust according to the contributions made, and also trusts where declaring an express trust has failed somehow or prematurely ended) and constuctive trusts. This can get a little academic at times but its fine. Constructive trusts have got to be by far the most random selection of topics you study. The distinction between constructive trusts as a remedy vs whether it is an institution or a relationship like a normal trust is very blurry. You learn about constructive trusts imposed where there's a 'common intention' that property be held in a particular way (literally just proprietary estoppel), unconsciability or failed joint venture constructive trusts, remedial ones for estoppel and breach of fiduciary duty (and particularly in relation to undisclosed profits and bribes), thieves, in cases of 'unjust enrichment', and mutual wills. The last four or five are quite nice and its disappointing they weren't really tested.

Overall, theres definitely a lot of content, and each has so much detail you can often struggle. Although the principles themselves are individually quite simple, being able to accurate know all of them over ten weeks is quite challenging.

### Assessment

This course has your standard 10% class participation, 30% group assignment, and 60% final exam.

As always in law, class participation is the fattest circlejerk in the world. I took an evening class so maybe there was less annoying people but htere was still a fair share. Probably 70% of students that show up say literally nothing and maybe 20% of that percenage leave after attendance is marked - but who am I to judge, people have lives and theres nothing wrong with that. In fact, what's worse is when my lecturer gets stunlocked by people in the front row asking the most obviously circular and cursory questions about material that would've been covered by now but because its been 40 minutes and we haven't started because you keep wanting to stare at the pretty bushes at the entrance of the forest we always end up not covering enough. That always sucks and it is what it is, but I suppose the only alternative would be people who are too scared to speak because the lecturer calls them out for stalling. This was by far my smallest class (sub 30 people) which maybe fanned the flames a bit. However the good thing about this subject is you don't have to stress about making contributions if you understand the principles, since it seems like nobody does the readings, so just being able to answer details about individual cases and drawing distinctions makes you the certified GOAT. The state of law education is a bit sad but that's something for another time.

You have a 30% assignment where you have to respond to basically a problem question (where you have to 'advise' people). The main distinction is that now you have a randomly selected group of 4-5 and you have to write an entire cohesive response together, worth 27%, and then a 3% reflection on how well you did in your group (individually) that's quite easy to write. The assignment mainly covers fiduciary obligations and assignment, with small cursory mentions of remedies (and although you study specific performance or injunctions, none of them are too relevant). Oh my fucking god though. I fucking hate group work especially in law. The problem is when people around you are so difficult to work with and communicate with that it hurts. 

I swear I'm a sociable person. But group assignments are just not the play here. Oh my fucking god. You want to start early? Well your entire group is gonna guilt trip you into doing it together so they can feel relevant. I really wanted to carry them but we got fucked over and we ended up rushing it last minute. The worst feeling ever is when you realise you haven't complied with AGLC by not putting the judicial officers (and you know this because you've done so in the past) in and nobody else is up and bothered and you've decided to take matters in your own hands and do everything by yourself and not tell anyone so they don't feel guilty. Fiduciary duties/relationships and assignment are actually really interesting, and answering the problem question is also quite interesting, but never do it last minute. And never trust your group. Don't learn from experience and you have to do everything yourself early - at least a first draft to work off of - and then dominate your group into submission. Otherwise you just end up co-parenting them by editing all their shitty hodge podge year seven English as a second language broken garbled word salad spaghetti into concise and neat writing. Is the lesson not to be a control freak? How is that possible when the word count includes citations? 

The exam is not too bad although the patterns get pretty formulaic. The first question is always about whether a valid trust has been constituted and whether there are any breaches. The second question is geared more towards resulting and constructive trusts with some accessorial liability (and you're given that the given trust is validly constituted). Tracing is sprinkled from either the first or second question or both occasionally. What's sad though is that there's a lot of topics that are almost never tested nor explored even though they're quite interesting. Personally I was very curious about constructive trusts arising from contracts capable of specific performance (quite nuanced especially where a contracting party has later gone insolvent or died or something so you can't actually seek specific performance), or mutual wills, or the lowest intermediate balance rule in tracing, or resulting trusts from incomplete dispositions, or more Saunders v Vautier shit, or more of the niche trust rules (especially statutory eg the defences). Writing this in advance of getting marks back (and I hope I did alright) I can say overall, maybe quite pretentiously, that the overall assessment structure felt quite weak in that it tested your patience and dealing with people that aren't up to your standards more than your understanding of the content. I truly am empathetic and understanding with other law students especially if things are difficult. But when they skip the readings, fail to do 'their part' by submitting AI garbled diarrohea or really stunted wilted language, it is just exhausting. Start early.

### Difficulty

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.difficulty} />

This course is only difficult because it relies a lot on understanding the motivations behind principles and how they interact. It could be the most rules-based course in the law degree, I wouldn't know because I haven't done them all, but it certainly feels that way. The content in the assignment is actually quite limited (really just two topics) but there's definitely a lot to talk about in the exam, especially timed with two hours (creation and breach of trust, remedies, accessorial liability, resulting and constructive trusts, tracing, etc). A lot of content from the online modules eg specific performance and injunctions are not really talked about that much and honestly never tested. I suppose some of the edge is taken off because some content is just straight up not tested, but whatever.

### Enjoyment

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.enjoyment} />

The principles are quite interesting in and of themselves once you learn about them. All the rules have their historical origins and policy reasons but are ultimately quite straightforward. There are just a lot of rules, but they are 'fun' to 'play' with. The most enjoyable parts of the course were actually doing problem questions (eg the assignment surprisingly although not for the group work) and there are a couple lessons near the end which are just a bunch of problem questions (tracing, resulting and constructive trusts). Those were quite fun although I enjoyed it more when we got to talk amongst ourselves individually and then share our answers rather than doing them as an entire class.

### Effort

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.effort} />

This course is quite sneaky because there are a lot of readings on the surface - you're forced to read entire chapters, sometimes two, in both the textbook and the casebook - but they actually repeat themselves. I actually found it much more efficient to read the casebook first (although the textbook is recommended first) because you learning the facts of the cases, but also the key principles, can coincide, while in the textbook its a lot harder to memorise particular cases. The textbook is useful sometimes to conform your understanding or learn about more niche example cases but there's not that much. I would usually skim the textbook and only add extra bits from my notes in the casebook if it was enough.

Even with the overlap though, there is a significant step up in reading compared to other law courses. This is by far the most reading I have ever done per seminar. While readings would usually take sub two hours for a lesson (I started timing them this year), the readings here, especially for the more dense topics, would easily take up to three hours on average. The edge is definitely taken off since in some lessons, especially in the last week, it is purely consolidation and no reading, which is nice. It is a bit insulting and not worth the effort though when some particular topics, with entire chapters devoted to them, are never tested nor talked about because they're in the online modules. I suppose such a huge course can't be perfect, or its hard enough as is.

### Delivery

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.delivery} />

Honestly where this course suffers the most is in its 'delivery'. What I mean by that is there seems to be a mismatch between the prescribed readings and what actually happens in the assessment and class participation parts. There are cases in parts of the assigned readings that are separate from the textbook but are which almost never talked about although they're quite interesting. It's quite sad. A lot of ones that are quite interesting albeit niche, and some super recent ones from this year as well. Maybe it was just my lecturer (who to be honest had the most barebones slides and improvised everything and kind of said uhh all the time to the point it was anoying) but it felt super disorienting to read something and then it never be reinforced when you come into class. Or maybe its just how difficult the content is. No idea.

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

All law courses will have amazing usefulness/utility unless you learn literally nothing. Finally understanding equity (what it is and why its developed as a separate but powerful body of law) and what a trust is is super nice, although you kind of learn the basics through osmosis in <CourseLink course="LAWS1150" /> (equitable estoppel and injunctions, also by the way its nice to know what a trust and assignment is now) and <CourseLink course="LAWS1075" /> (eg the penalties doctrine, rescission and vitiating factors).
