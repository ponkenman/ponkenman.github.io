### Overview

Prerequisites: None

This course is a very misleading introduction to law because it is INCREDIBLY boring, especially since for most people this is their first uni course and they are wracked with nervousness and a general air of posturing and immaturity. However, it kind of has to be. You spend six weeks learning about the history of the common law, the gist of which you could have learnt from a skim of a Wikipedia page. The only interesting things taught during this period are the native title cases (one lesson) and the development of negligence (another lesson). This was a bit confusing, however, since negligence would be expanded on later in <CourseLink course="LAWS1061" />. The first few lessons were especially confusing because it was as if they were teaching us how to read. Here comes the airplane type shit. But it is understandable.


Then the course gets interesting when you learn about intentional torts (assault, battery, false imprisonment) and their defences, as well as statutory interpretation. I wish I actually paid attention because these were so interesting and a very nice intro to problem solving questions. However, even then, the amount of detail you go into each topic is rather small. My lecturer had some entertaining stories about their experience as a barrister, but apart from that there was no silver lining of this course. It is quite mediocre, and if you told me that I was spending the equivalent of $60/hr to come here, I would have jumped out of the nearest window.


The first law assignment involved writing a case note. We had very little instructions and guidance on what to write. It was agonising to say the least. It was like walking in the dark and not knowing which way is up and trying to find a paper clip on the floor and being admonished when you couldn't do it. How can we give you what you want if we don't know what you want from us? It felt like a toxic relationship. Did I get a miserable mark in probably the easiest assignment ever? Yes I did. Pro tip: they always do a case where a court finds that a police officer's entry onto private land was unlawful, so 'relevant concepts' is always going to be a codeword for the separation of powers.


also attended an early morning class, which I do not recommend. I also feel like the snobbiest and most self centred and difficult and arrogant people attend those classes, so avoid if you can! Or maybe it's just me!

### Difficulty

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.difficulty} />

This is the easiest that the law gets. It's literally Legal Studies with what feels like trivia. Honestly wish there was more into the intention torts part...

### Effort

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.effort} />

I had a lecturer who didn't even do CP and replaced it with a case note instead. How are you even supposed to do CP in the first place? The content is literally fucking history. "Oh I was surprised by the fact that the common law was because judges would go around in medieval England to set precedents and do similar decisions on similar cases" shut the fuck up you're so desparate its cringeworthy af...


It's ironic that this course also tries to preach to you about mental health in the profession when its exactly this kind of boring yet purposefully and a little bit maliciously obtuse kind of shit that makes law seem shit.

### Delivery

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.delivery} />

I had a lecturer who was quite interesting... but other than that this course is run like shit. Like trying to bang your head along to a dirge or like counting the amount of birds that fly occasionally over the pit that you're stuck in.

### Utility

<StarBar total={5} filled={frontmatter.utility} />

The only thing good about this course is learning (really shitly) how equity was created (historically, and before you do the actual course on equity). That gives you some bonus CPs in some other subjects where its relevant... otherwise this course is so pointless its unreal.

To be fair, intentional torts is also pretty fun, and this is probably the only place where you can do problem questions with no sharp corners (ie everything is relatively easy).
